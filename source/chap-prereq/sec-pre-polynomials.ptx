	<introduction>
		<p>
			There are several components of differential equations, particularly higher order
			equations and systems, that involve dealing with and finding roots of polynomials, using
			these results to generate solutions to differential equations. This appendix will review
			some properties of and techniques related to polynomials.

		<title>Definitions and Operations</title>

		<p> First we start with the definition of a polynomial. A <em>polynomial</em> is a sum of
			terms each of which is a real number or a real number multiplied by one or more
			variables to natural number powers. Some examples of polynomials are <m>x^2 + x\sqrt{3}
			+ 4</m>, <m>27x^2y + \frac{7x}{2}</m> and <m>6</m>. Things like <m>3\sqrt{x}</m>, <m>4x
			- \frac{2}{x+1}</m> and <m>13x^{2/3}y^{2}</m> are <em>not</em> polynomials. Below, we
			review some terminology about polynomials. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="definition"-->
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p> Terms in polynomials without variables are called <em>constant</em> terms. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p> In non-constant terms, the real number factor in the expression is called
						the <em>coefficient</em> of the term. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p> The <em>degree</em> of a non-constant term is the sum of the exponents on
						the variables in the term; non-zero constant terms are defined to have
						degree <m>0</m>. The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of the
						nonzero terms. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p> Terms in a polynomial are called <em>like</em> terms if they have the same
						variables each with the same corresponding exponents. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p> A polynomial is said to be <em>simplified</em> if all arithmetic operations
						have been completed and there are no longer any like terms. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						A simplified polynomial is called a
					</p>

					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<em>monomial</em> if it has exactly one nonzero term </p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>
									<em>binomial</em> if it has exactly two nonzero terms </p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>
									<em>trinomial</em> if it has exactly three nonzero terms </p>
							</li>

						</ul>
					</p>
				</li>

			</ul>
		</p><!--</div
		attr= class="definition">-->

		<p> For example, <m>x^2 + x\sqrt{3} +4</m> is a trinomial of degree <m>2</m>. The
			coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is <m>1</m> and the constant term is <m>4</m>. The polynomial <m>27x^2y
			+ \frac{7x}{2}</m> is a binomial of degree <m>3</m> (<m>x^2y = x^2 y^1</m>) with
			constant term <m>0</m>. </p>

		<p> The concept of <sq>like</sq> terms really amounts to finding terms which can be combined
			using the Distributive Property. For example, in the polynomial <m>17x^2y - 3xy^2 +
			7xy^2</m>, <m>-3xy^2</m> and <m>7xy^2</m> are like terms, since they have the same
			variables with the same corresponding exponents. This allows us to combine these two
			terms as follows: <me>17x^2y - 3xy^2 + 7xy^2 = 17x^2y + (-3)xy^2 + 7xy^2 + 17x^2y +(-3 +
			7)xy^2 = 17x^2y + 4xy^2</me> Note that even though <m>17x^2y</m> and <m>4xy^2</m> have
			the same variables, they are not like terms since in the first term we have <m>x^2</m>
			and <m>y = y^1</m> but in the second we have <m>x = x^1</m> and <m>y = y^2</m> so the
			corresponding exponents aren’t the same. Hence, <m>17x^2y + 4xy^2</m> is the simplified
			form of the polynomial. </p>

		<p>
			There are four basic operations we can perform with polynomials: addition, subtraction,
			multiplication and division. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication follow the
			standard properties of real numbers after distributing or expanding all terms (for
			multiplication) and then collecting like terms again. Division, on the other hand, is a
			bit more complicated and will be discussed next.
		</p>

	</subsection>
	<subsection xml:id="polynomial-long-division">
		<title>Polynomial Long Division</title>

		<p> We now turn our attention to polynomial long division. Dividing two polynomials follows
			the same algorithm, in principle, as dividing two natural numbers so we review that
			process first. Suppose we wished to divide <m>2585</m> by <m>79</m>. The standard
			division tableau is given below. </p>

		<p>
			<me>\begin{array}{cccccc}

				&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \\ \hhline{~~|----}

				7 &amp; 9 \, \vline &amp; \, 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 &amp; 5 \\

				&amp; -&amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 &amp; \downarrow \\ \hhline{~~---}
				&amp; &amp; &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\
				&amp; &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\ \hhline{~~~---}
				&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 5 &amp; 7 \\


				\end{array}</me>
		</p>

		<p> In this case, <m>79</m> is called the <em>divisor</em>, <m>2585</m> is called the <em>
			dividend</em>, <m>32</m> is called the <em>quotient</em> and <m>57</m> is called the <em>
			remainder</em>. We can check our answer by showing: <me>\text{dividend} =
			(\text{divisor})( \text{quotient}) + \text{remainder}</me> or in this case, <m>2585 =
			(79)(32) + 57 \checkmark</m>. We hope that the long division tableau evokes warm, fuzzy
			memories of your formative years as opposed to feelings of hopelessness and frustration.
			If you experience the latter, keep in mind that the Division Algorithm essentially is a
			two-step process, iterated over and over again. First, we guess the number of times the
			divisor goes into the dividend and then we subtract off our guess. We repeat those steps
			with what’s left over until what’s left over (the remainder) is less than what we
			started with (the divisor). That’s all there is to it! </p>

		<p> The division algorithm for polynomials has the same basic two steps but when we subtract
			polynomials, we must take care to subtract <em>like terms</em> only. As a transition to
			polynomial division, let’s write out our previous division tableau in expanded form. </p>

		<p>
			<me>\begin{array}{cccccccccc}

				&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 3 \cdot 10 &amp; + &amp; 2 \\
				\hhline{~~~|-------}

				7 \cdot 10 &amp; + &amp; 9 \, \vline&amp; 2\cdot 10^3 &amp; + &amp; 5 \cdot 10^2
				&amp; + &amp; 8 \cdot 10 &amp; + &amp; 5 \\

				&amp; &amp; -&amp; \left(2 \cdot 10^3 \right. &amp; + &amp; 3 \cdot 10^2 &amp; +
				&amp; \left. 7 \cdot 10 \right) &amp; &amp; \downarrow \\ \hhline{~~~-----~~}
				&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 2 \cdot 10^2 &amp; + &amp; 1 \cdot 10 &amp; + &amp; 5
				\\
				&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; - &amp; \left(1 \cdot 10^2 \right. &amp; + &amp; 5 \cdot 10
				&amp; + &amp;\left. 8 \right) \\ \hhline{~~~~~---~~}
				&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 5 \cdot 10 &amp; + &amp; 7 \\


				\end{array}</me>
		</p>

		<p> Written this way, we see that when we line up the digits we are really lining up the
			coefficients of the corresponding powers of <m>10</m> - much like how we’ll have to keep
			the powers of <m>x</m> lined up in the same columns. The big difference between
			polynomial division and the division of natural numbers is that the value of <m>x</m> is
			an unknown quantity. So unlike using the known value of <m>10</m>, when we subtract
			there can be no regrouping of coefficients as in our previous example. (The subtraction <m>215
			- 158</m> requires us to <sq>regroup</sq> or <sq>borrow</sq> from the tens digit, then
			the hundreds digit.) This actually makes polynomial division easier.<fn>
				
					In our opinion - you can judge for yourself.
				
			</fn>
			Before we dive into examples, we first state a theorem telling us when we can divide two
			polynomials, and what to expect when we do so. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="theorem1"-->
		<p> Polynomial Division Let <m>d</m> and <m>p</m> be nonzero polynomials where the degree of <m>
			p</m> is greater than or equal to the degree of <m>d</m>. There exist two unique
			polynomials, <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>, such that <m>p = d \cdot q + r,\,</m> where either <m>r
			= 0</m> or the degree of <m>r</m> is strictly less than the degree of <m>d</m>. </p><!--</div
		attr= class="theorem1">-->

		<p> Essentially, Theorem <xref ref="polydiv" /> tells us that we can divide polynomials
			whenever the degree of the divisor is less than or equal to the degree of the dividend.
			We know we’re done with the division when the polynomial left over (the remainder) has a
			degree strictly less than the divisor. It’s time to walk through a few examples to
			refresh your memory. </p>

		<p> Usually, when we want to divide polynomials, it is because we are trying to find all
			roots of a polynomial. This comes from the idea that if we have a polynomial <m>p(x)</m>
			and a value <m>x_0</m> so that <m>p(x_0) = 0</m>, then <m>x_0</m> is a root of the
			polynomial. This means that <m>(x-x_0)</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>, so that we can
			write <me>p(x) = (x-x_0)q(x)</me> where <m>q(x)</m> is a polynomial with one lower
			degree than <m>p</m>. We can find this <m>q(x)</m> by dividing <me>q(x) =
			\frac{p(x)}{x-x_0},</me> which is why we need division to sort this out. </p>

		<p> This means that we need to find the roots (or at least a root) to know what to divide <m>

					factors of constant term, <m>a_{\mbox{\tiny$0$}} = -3</m>, and divide them by
					each of the factors of the leading coefficient <m>a_{\mbox{\tiny$4$}} = 2</m>.
					The factors of <m>-3</m> are <m>\pm \, 1</m> and <m>\pm \, 3</m>. Since the
					Rational Zeros Theorem tacks on a <m>\pm</m> anyway, for the moment, we consider
					only the positive factors <m>1</m> and <m>3</m>. The factors of <m>2</m> are <m>
					1</m> and <m>2</m>, so the Rational Zeros Theorem gives the list <m>\left\{\pm
					\, \frac{1}{1}, \pm \, \frac{1}{2}, \pm \, \frac{3}{1}, \pm \,
					\frac{3}{2}\right\}</m> or <m>\left\{\pm \, \frac{1}{2}, \pm \, 1, \pm \,
					\frac{3}{2}, \pm \, 3\right\}</m>. </p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p> But this still doesn’t make the process easy or straight-forward for finding the roots.
			How can we take this list of options and easily figure out where the roots are, and what
			the remaining polynomial <m>q(x)</m> is? </p>

		<p> We start by way of example: suppose we wish to determine the zeros of <m>f(x) = x^3 +
			4x^2-5x-14</m>. Setting <m>f(x)=0</m> results in the polynomial equation <m>x^3 +
			4x^2-5x-14=0</m>. Despite all of the factoring techniques we learned (and forgot!), this
			equation foils<fn>
				
					pun intended
				
			</fn> us at every turn. Knowing that the
			zeros of <m>f</m> correspond to <m>x</m>-intercepts on the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>, we
			use a graphing utility to produce the graph below on the left. The graph suggests that
			the function has three zeros, one of which appears to be <m>x=2</m> and two others for
			whom we are provided what we assume to be decimal approximations: <m>x \approx -4.414</m>
			and <m>x \approx -1.586</m>. We can verify if these are zeros easily enough. We find <m>f(2)
			=(2)^2 + 4(2)^2-5(2)-14 = 0</m>, but <m>f(-4.414) \approx 0.0039</m> and <m>f(-1.586)
			\approx 0.0022</m>, While these last two values are probably by some measures, <sq>close</sq>
			to <m>0</m>, they are not <em>exactly</em> equal to <m>0</m>. The question becomes: is
			there a way to use the fact that <m>x=2</m> is a zero to obtain the other two zeros?
			Based on our experience, if <m>x=2</m> is a zero, it seems that there should be a factor
			of <m>(x-2)</m> lurking around in the factorization of <m>f(x)</m>. In other words, we
			should expect that <m>x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14=(x-2) \, q(x)</m>, where <m>q(x)</m> is some
			other polynomial. How could we find such a <m>q(x)</m>, if it even exists? The answer
			comes from our old friend, polynomial division. Below on the right, we perform the long
			division: <m>(x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14) \div (x-2)</m> and obtain <m>x^2+6x+7</m>. </p>

		<p> Said differently, <m>f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2-5x-14=(x-2)\left(x^2+6x+7\right)</m>. Using this
			form of <m>f(x)</m>, we find the zeros by solving <m>(x-2)\left(x^2+6x+7\right)=0</m>.
			Setting each factor equal to <m>0</m>, we get <m>x-2=0</m> (which gives us our known

		<p> As you may recall, all of the polynomials in Theorem <xref ref="polydivthm" /> have

			then by <m>-1</m> when we changed the subtraction to addition. Multiplying by <m>-2</m>
			then by <m>-1</m> is the same as multiplying by <m>2</m>, so we replace the <m>-2</m> in
			the divisor by <m>2</m>. Furthermore, the coefficients of the quotient polynomial match
			the coefficients of the first three terms in the last row, so we now take the plunge and

		<p> We have constructed a <em>synthetic division tableau</em> for this polynomial division

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> The Remainder Theorem states <m>p(-2)</m> is the remainder when <m>
								p(x)</m> is divided by <m>x-(-2)</m>. We set up our synthetic
								division tableau below. We are careful to record the coefficient of <m>
								x^2</m> as <m>0</m>: </p>

							<p>
								<me>\begin{array}{rrrrr}

									&amp; 2 &amp; -4 &amp; 3 &amp; \fbox{$-3$} \\
									\end{array}</me>
							</p>

							<p> According to the Remainder Theorem, <m>p(-2) = -3</m>. We can check
								this by direct substitution into the formula for <m>p(x)</m>: <m>p(-2)
								= 2(-2)^3-5(-2)+3 = -16+10+3=-3</m>. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p> We verify <m>x=1</m> is a zero of <m>p</m> by evaluating <m>p(1) =
								2(1)^3-5(1)+3 = 0</m>. To see if there are any more real zeros, we
								need to solve <m>p(x) = 2x^3-5x+3 = 0</m>. From the Factor Theorem,
								we know since <m>p(1) = 0</m>, we can factor <m>p(x)</m> as <m>
								(x-1)q(x)</m>. To find <m>q(x)</m>, we use synthetic division: </p>

							<p>

							</p>

							<p> As promised, our remainder is <m>0</m>, and we get <m>p(x) =
								(x-1)\left( 2x^2 + 2x - 3\right)</m>. Setting this form of <m>p(x)</m>
								equal to <m>0</m> we get <m>(x-1)\left( 2x^2 + 2x - 3\right) = 0</m>.
								We recover <m>x = 1</m> from setting <m>x-1=0</m> but we also obtain <m>x
								= \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{7}}{2}</m> from <m>2x^2 + 2x - 3=0</m>,

		<p> Our next example demonstrates how we can extend the synthetic division tableau to

		<example>
			<title> </title>
			<statement>
				<p> Let <m>p(x) = 4x^4-4x^3-11x^2+12x-3</m>. Show <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m> is a zero of

			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p> While computing <m>p\left(\frac{1}{2} \right) = 0</m> shows <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m>
					is a zero of <m>p</m>, to prove it has multiplicity <m>2</m>, we need to factor <m>p(x)
					= \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 q(x)</m> with <m>q\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)
					\neq 0</m>,. We set up for synthetic division, but instead of stopping after the
					first division, we continue the tableau downwards and divide <m>\left(x -
					\frac{1}{2}\right)</m> directly into the quotient we obtained from the first
					division as follows: </p>

				<p>
					<me>\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
						\frac{1}{2} \, \, \vline&amp; 4 &amp; -4 &amp; -11 &amp; 12 &amp; -3 \\

						&amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; -12 &amp; \fbox{0} &amp; \\


						\end{array}</me>
				</p>

				<p> We get:<fn>
						For those wanting more detail: the first division gives: <m>4x^4-4x^3-11x^2+12x-3=\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)
					\left(4x^3-2x^2-12x+6\right)</m>. The second division gives: <m>
					4x^3-2x^2-12x+6=\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(4x^2-12\right)</m>. 
					</fn> <m>4x^4-4x^3-11x^2+12x-3
					= \left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\left(4x^2-12\right)</m>. Note if we let <m>q(x) =
					4x^2-12</m>, then <m>q\left(\frac{1}{2} \right) = 4\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 -
					12 = -11 \neq 0</m> which proves <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m> is a zero of <m>p</m> of
					multiplicity <m>2</m>. To find the remaining zeros of <m>p</m>, we set the
					quotient <m>4x^2-12=0</m>, so <m>x^2 = 3</m> and extract square roots to get <m>x
					= \pm \sqrt{3}</m>. </p>

			One last wrinkle in this process is complex roots, since it is possible for a polynomial

			</ul>
		</p><!--</div

		<p> Note that every real number is a complex number, that is <m>\mathbb{R} \subseteq
			\mathbb{C}</m>. To see this, take your favorite real number, say <m>117</m>. We may
			write <m>117 = 117 + 0 i</m> which puts in the form <m>a + bi</m>. Hence, we we speak of
			the <sq>complex zeros</sq> of a polynomial function, we are talking about not just the
			non-real, but also the real zeros. </p>

		<p> Complex numbers, by their very definition, are two dimensional creatures. To see this,
			we may identify a complex number <m>z = a+bi</m> with the point in the Cartesian plane <m>
			(a,b)</m>. The horizontal axis is called the <sq>real</sq> axis since points here have
			the form <m>(a,0)</m> which corresponds to numbers of the form <m>z = a + 0i = a</m>
			which are the real numbers. The vertical axis is called the <sq>imaginary</sq> axis
			since points here are of the form <m>(0,b)</m> which correspond to numbers of the form <m>z
			= 0+bi = bi</m>, the so-called <sq>purely imaginary</sq> numbers. Below we plot some
			complex numbers on this so-called <sq>Complex Plane.</sq> Plotting a set of complex
			numbers this way is called an <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">Argand
			Diagram</url>, and opens up a wealth of opportunities to explore many algebraic
			properties of complex numbers geometrically. For example, complex conjugation amounts to
			a reflection about the real axis, and multiplication by <m>i</m> amounts to a <m>
			90^{\circ}</m> rotation. While we won’t have much use for the Complex Plane in this
			section, it is worth introducing this concept now, if, for no other reason, it gives the
			reader a sense of the vastness of the complex number system and the role of the real
			numbers in it. </p>

		<p> Returning to zeros of polynomials, suppose we wish to find the zeros of <m>f(x) =
			x^2-2x+5</m>. To solve the equation <m>x^2-2x+5 = 0</m>, we note that the quadratic
			doesn’t factor nicely, so we resort to the Quadratic Formula and obtain <me>x =
			\dfrac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} = \dfrac{2 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} = \dfrac{2
			\pm 4i}{2} = 1 \pm 2i.</me> Two things are important to note. First, the zeros <m>1+2i</m>
			and <m>1-2i</m> are complex conjugates. If ever we obtain non-real zeros to a quadratic
			function with <em>real number</em> coefficients, the zeros will be a complex conjugate
			pair. (Do you see why?) </p>

		<p> We could ask if all of the theory of polynomial division holds for non-real zeros, in

			yes.</sq>

		<p> Indeed, the above shows <m>x^2-2x+5 = (x-[1+2i])(x-1+2i)= (x-[1+2i])(x-[1-2i])</m> which

		</p>

		<p> But how do we know if a general polynomial has any complex zeros at all? We have many
			examples of polynomials with no real zeros. Can there be polynomials with no zeros
			whatsoever? The answer to that last question is <q>No.</q> and the theorem which
			provides that answer is The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="theorem1"-->
		<p> The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra Suppose <m>f</m> is a polynomial function with
			complex number coefficients of degree <m>n \geq 1</m>, then <m>f</m> has at least one
			complex zero. </p><!--</div
		attr= class="theorem1">-->

		<p> The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is an example of an <sq>existence</sq> theorem in
			Mathematics. Like the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
			guarantees the existence of at least one zero, but gives us no algorithm to use in
			finding it. In fact, as we mentioned previously, there are polynomials whose real zeros,
			though they exist, cannot be expressed using the <sq>usual</sq> combinations of
			arithmetic symbols, and must be approximated. It took mathematicians literally hundreds

					So if its profound nature and beautiful subtlety escape you, no worries!
				
			</fn>
			and some of that history is recorded <url
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra"></url>. Note that
			the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra applies to not only polynomial functions with real
			coefficients, but to those with complex number coefficients as well. </p>

		<p> Suppose <m>f</m> is a polynomial function of degree <m>n \geq 1</m>. The Fundamental
			Theorem of Algebra guarantees us at least one complex zero, <m>z_{\mbox{\tiny $1$}}</m>.
			The Factor Theorem guarantees that <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>f(x) = \left(x -
			z_{\mbox{\tiny $1$}}\right) q_{\mbox{\tiny $1$}}(x)</m> for a polynomial function <m>q_{\mbox{\tiny
			$1$}}</m>, which has degree <m>n-1</m>. If <m>n-1 \geq 1</m>, then the Fundamental
			Theorem of Algebra guarantees a complex zero of <m>q_{\mbox{\tiny $1$}}</m> as well, say <m>z_{\mbox{\tiny
			$2$}}</m>, so then the Factor Theorem gives us <m>q_{\mbox{\tiny $1$}}(x) = \left(x -
			z_{\mbox{\tiny $2$}}\right) q_{\mbox{\tiny $2$}}(x)</m>, and hence <m>f(x) = \left(x -
			z_{\mbox{\tiny $1$}}\right) \left(x - z_{\mbox{\tiny $2$}}\right) q_{\mbox{\tiny
			$2$}}(x)</m>. We can continue this process exactly <m>n</m> times, at which point our
			quotient polynomial <m>q_{\mbox{\tiny $n$}}</m> has degree <m>0</m> so it’s a constant.
			This constant is none-other than the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> which is carried
			down line by line each time we divide by factors of the form <m>x-c</m>. </p>

			<solution>
				<p> To solve this problem, we will need a good understanding of the relationship
					between the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of a function and the zeros of a
					function, the Factor Theorem, the role of multiplicity, complex conjugates, the
					Complex Factorization Theorem, and end behavior of polynomial functions. (In
					short, you’ll need most of the major concepts of this chapter.) Since the graph
					of <m>p</m> touches the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>\left(\frac{1}{3}, 0\right)</m>, we
					know <m>x=\frac{1}{3}</m> is a zero of even multiplicity. Since we are after a
					polynomial of lowest degree, we need <m>x=\frac{1}{3}</m> to have multiplicity
					exactly <m>2</m>. The Factor Theorem now tells us <m>
					\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>. Since <m>x=3i</m>
					is a zero and our final answer is to have integer (hence, real) coefficients, <m>
					x=-3i</m> is also a zero. The Factor Theorem kicks in again to give us <m>(x-3i)</m>
					and <m>(x+3i)</m> as factors of <m>p(x)</m>. We are given no further information
					about zeros or intercepts so we conclude, by the Complex Factorization Theorem
					that <m>p(x) = a \left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 (x-3i)(x+3i)</m> for some real
					number <m>a</m>. Expanding this, we get <m>p(x) = ax^4-\frac{2a}{3}
					x^3+\frac{82a}{9} x^2-6ax+a</m>. In order to obtain integer coefficients, we
					know <m>a</m> must be an integer multiple of <m>9</m>. Our last concern is end
					behavior. Since the leading term of <m>p(x)</m> is <m>ax^4</m>, we need <m>a
					&lt; 0</m> to get <m>p(x) \rightarrow -\infty</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>.
					Hence, if we choose <m>x=-9</m>, we get <m>p(x) = -9x^4+ 6 x^3 - 82 x^2+54x-9</m>.
					We can verify our handiwork using the techniques developed in this chapter. </p>
