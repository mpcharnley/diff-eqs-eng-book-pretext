		<p> Let us return back to the example of a mass on a spring. We examine the case of forced
			oscillations, which we did not yet handle. That is, we consider the equation <me>
				mx'' + \gamma x' + kx = F(t) ,
			</me> for some nonzero <m>F(t)</m>. The setup is
			again: <m>m</m> is mass, <m>\gamma</m> is friction, <m>k</m> is the spring constant, and <m>
			F(t)</m> is an external force acting on the mass. </p>

			We are interested in periodic forcing, such as noncentered rotating parts, or perhaps

		<title>Undamped forced motion and resonance</title>

		<p> First let us consider undamped (<m>\gamma =0</m>) motion. We have the equation <me>
				mx'' + kx = F_0 \cos (\omega t) .
			</me> This equation has the complementary solution
			(solution to the associated homogeneous equation) <me>
				x_c = C_1 \cos (\omega_0 t) + C_2 \sin (\omega_0 t) ,
			</me> where <m>\omega_0 =
			\sqrt{\nicefrac{k}{m}}</m> is the <em></em> (angular). It is the frequency at which the
			system without external interference. </p>

		<p> Suppose that <m>\omega_0 \not= \omega</m>. We try the solution <m>x_p = A \cos (\omega
			t)</m> and solve for <m>A</m>. We do not need a sine in our trial solution as after
			plugging in we only have cosines. If you include a sine, it is fine; you will find that
			its coefficient is zero (I could not find a second rhyme). </p>

		<p> We solve using the method of undetermined coefficients. We find that <me>
				x_p = \frac{F_0}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \cos (\omega t) .
			</me> We leave it as an
			exercise to do the algebra required. </p>

		<p> The general solution is <me>
				\mybxbg{
				~~
				x = C_1 \cos (\omega_0 t) + C_2 \sin (\omega_0 t) +
				\frac{F_0}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \cos (\omega t) .
				~~
				}
			</me>
			Written another way <me>
				x = C \cos (\omega_0 t - \gamma) +
				\frac{F_0}{m(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)} \cos (\omega t) .
			</me>
			The solution is a superposition of two cosine waves at different frequencies. </p>


		<example>
			<title> </title>
			<statement>
				<p> Take <me>
						0.5 x'' + 8 x = 10 \cos (\pi t), \qquad x(0)=0, \qquad x'(0)=0 .
					</me>

				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p> Let us compute. First we read off the parameters: <m>\omega = \pi</m>, <m>\omega_0
					= \sqrt{\nicefrac{8}{0.5}} = 4</m>, <m>F_0 = 10</m>, <m>m=0.5</m>. The general
					solution is <me>
						x = C_1 \cos (4 t) + C_2 \sin (4 t) +
						\frac{20}{16 - \pi^2} \cos (\pi t) .
					</me>

				</p>

				<!-- div attr= class="mywrapfig"-->
				<p>
					3.25in
				</p><!--</div
				attr= class="mywrapfig">-->

				<p> Solve for <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> using the initial conditions: <m>C_1 =
					\frac{-20}{16 - \pi^2}</m> and <m>C_2 = 0</m>. Hence <me>
						x =
						\frac{20}{16 - \pi^2} \bigl( \cos (\pi t)- \cos (4 t) \bigr) .
					</me>

				</p>

				<p> Notice the behavior in . First use the trigonometric identity <me>
						2\sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) =
						\cos B -\cos A
					</me>
					to get <me>
						x =
						\frac{20}{16 - \pi^2} \left( 2 \sin \left(\frac{4-\pi}{2} t \right)
						\sin \left( \frac{4+\pi}{2} t \right) \right) .
					</me>
					The function <m>x</m> is a high frequency wave modulated by a low frequency
					wave. </p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p> The beating behavior can be experienced even more readily by considering a higher
			frequency and viewing the resulting function as a sound wave. A sound wave of frequency
			440 Hz produces and A4 sound, which is the A above middle C on a piano. This means that
			the function <me>
				x_p(t) = \sin(2\pi\cdot 440 t)
			</me> will produce a sound wave equivalent to this A4
			sound. In MATLAB, this can be done with the code </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="matlab"-->
		<p>
			omega0 = 440*2*pi; tVals = linspace(0, 5, 5*8192);

		<p>
			testSound = sin(omega0*tVals); sound(testSound);

		<p> which will play this pitch for 5 seconds. Now, we want to see what happens if we take a
			mass-on-a-spring with this natural frequency and apply a forcing function with frequency
			close to this value. The following code assumes a forcing function of frequency 444 Hz.
			The multiple of <m>\omega_0</m> in front of the forcing function is only for scaling
			purposes; otherwise the resulting sound would be too quiet. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="matlab"-->
		<p>
			omega = 444*2*pi;

		<p>
			syms ys(t); [V] = odeToVectorField(diff(ys, 2) + omega0^2*ys == omega0*cos(omega*t)); MS
			= matlabFunction(V, ’vars’, ’t’, ’Y’); soln = ode45(MS, [0,10], [0,0]);
		</p>

		<p>
			ySound = deval(soln, tVals); ySound = ySound(1, :); sound(ySound);
		</p><!--</div
		attr= class="matlab">-->

		<p> A graph of the solution <c>ySound</c> can be found in . This exhibits the beating

			tuning instruments, these beats are some of the main things musicians will listen for to
			know if their instrument is close to the right pitch, but just slightly off. </p>

		<p> Now suppose <m>\omega_0 = \omega</m>. We cannot try the solution <m>A \cos (\omega t)</m>
			and then use the method of undetermined coefficients, since we notice that <m>\cos
			(\omega t)</m> solves the associated homogeneous equation. Therefore, we try <m>x_p = A
			t \cos (\omega t) + B t \sin (\omega t)</m>. This time we need the sine term, since the
			second derivative of <m>t \cos (\omega t)</m> contains sines. We write the equation <me>
			x'' + \omega^2 x = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos ( \omega t) .
			</me> Plugging <m>x_p</m> into
			the left-hand side we get <me>
				2 B \omega \cos (\omega t) - 2 A \omega \sin (\omega t) =
				\frac{F_0}{m} \cos (\omega t) .
			</me>
			Hence <m>A = 0</m> and <m>B = \frac{F_0}{2m\omega}</m>. Our particular solution is <m>\frac{F_0}{2m\omega}
			\, t \sin (\omega t)</m> and our general solution is <me>
				x = C_1 \cos (\omega t) + C_2 \sin (\omega t)
				+ \frac{F_0}{2m\omega} \, t \sin (\omega t) .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> The important term is the last one (the particular solution we found). This term grows
			without bound as <m>t \to \infty</m>. In fact it oscillates between <m>\frac{F_0
			t}{2m\omega}</m> and <m>\frac{- F_0 t}{2m\omega}</m>. The first two terms only oscillate
			between <m>\pm\sqrt{C_1^2 + C_2^2}</m>, which becomes smaller and smaller in proportion
			to the oscillations of the last term as <m>t</m> gets larger. In we see the graph with <m>
			C_1=C_2=0</m>, <m>F_0 = 2</m>, <m>m=1</m>, <m>\omega = \pi</m>. </p>

		<p> By forcing the system in just the right frequency we produce very wild oscillations.
			This kind of behavior is called <em></em> or perhaps <em></em>. Sometimes resonance is
			desired. For example, remember when as a kid you could start swinging by just moving
			back and forth on the swing seat in the ? You were trying to achieve resonance. The
			force of each one of your moves was small, but after a while it produced large swings. </p>

		<p>
			On the other hand resonance can be destructive. In an earthquake some buildings collapse
			while others may be relatively undamaged. This is due to different buildings having
			different resonance frequencies. So figuring out the resonance frequency can be very
			important.

		<title>Damped forced motion and practical resonance</title>

		<p> In real life things are not as simple as they were above. There is, of course, some
			damping. Our equation becomes <men xml:id="ForcedOsc-deq">
				mx'' + \gamma x' + kx = F_0 \cos (\omega t) ,
			</men> for some <m>\gamma &gt; 0</m>.
			We solved the homogeneous problem before. We let <me>
				p = \frac{\gamma}{2m}, \qquad \omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} .
			</me> We replace
			equation <xref ref="ForcedOsc-deq" /> with <me>
				x'' + 2px' + \omega_0^2x = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos (\omega t) .
			</me> The roots of the
			characteristic equation of the associated homogeneous problem are <m>r_1,r_2 = -p \pm
			\sqrt{p^2 - \omega_0^2}</m>. The form of the general solution of the associated
			homogeneous equation depends on the sign of <m>p^2 - \omega_0^2</m>, or equivalently on
			the sign of <m>\gamma^2 - 4km</m>, as before: <me>
				x_c =
				\begin{cases}
				C_1 e^{r_1 t} + C_2 e^{r_2 t} &amp; \text{if } \; \gamma^2 &gt; 4km , \\
				C_1 e^{-p t} + C_2 t e^{-p t} &amp; \text{if } \; \gamma^2 = 4km , \\
				e^{-p t} \bigl( C_1 \cos (\omega_1 t) + C_2 \sin (\omega_1 t) \bigr) &amp;
				\text{if } \; \gamma^2 &lt; 4km ,
				\end{cases}
			</me>
			where <m>\omega_1 = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - p^2}</m>. In any case, we see that <m>x_c(t) \to
			0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>. </p>

		<p> Let us find a particular solution. There can be no conflicts when trying to solve for
			the undetermined coefficients by trying <m>x_p = A \cos (\omega t)
				+ B \sin (\omega t)</m>, because the solution to the homogeneous problem will always
			have exponential factors (since we have damping) and so there is no <m>\omega</m> where
			this will exactly match the form of the homogeneous solution. Let us plug in and solve
			for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. We get (the details are left to reader) <me>
				\bigl((\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)B - 2\omega p A\bigr) \sin (\omega t)
				+
				\bigl((\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)A + 2\omega p B\bigr) \cos (\omega t)
				=
				\frac{F_0}{m} \cos (\omega t) .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> We solve for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>: <me>\begin{align*}
				&amp; A=\frac{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2) F_0}
				{m{(2\omega p)}^2+m{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2} , \\
				&amp; B=\frac{2 \omega p F_0}
				{m{(2\omega p)}^2+m{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2} .
				\end{align*}</me> We also compute <m>C = \sqrt{A^2+B^2}</m> to be <me>
				C = \frac{F_0}{m \sqrt{{(2\omega p)}^2+{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2}} .
			</me> Thus our
			particular solution is <me>
				x_p =
				\frac{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2) F_0}
				{m{(2\omega p)}^2+m{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2} \cos (\omega t) +
				\frac{2 \omega p F_0}
				{m{(2\omega p)}^2+m{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2} \sin (\omega t) .
			</me>
			Or in the alternative notation we have amplitude <m>C</m> and phase shift <m>\delta</m>
			where (if <m>\omega \not= \omega_0</m>) <me>
				\tan \delta = \frac{B}{A} = \frac{2\omega p}{\omega_0^2-\omega^2} .
			</me> Hence, <me>
			\mybxbg{~~
				x_p =
				\frac{F_0}{m \sqrt{{(2\omega p)}^2+{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2}}
				\cos ( \omega t - \delta ) .
				~~}
			</me>
			If <m>\omega = \omega_0</m>, then <m>A=0</m>, <m>B = C = \frac{F_0}{2m\omega p}</m>, and <m>\delta
			= \nicefrac{\pi}{2}</m>. </p>

		<p> For reasons we will explain in a moment, we call <m>x_c</m> the <em></em> and denote it
			by <m>x_{tr}</m>. We call the <m>x_p</m> from above the <em></em> and denote it by <m>
			x_{sp}</m>. The general solution is <me>
				x = x_c + x_p = x_{tr} + x_{sp} .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> The transient solution <m>x_c = x_{tr}</m> goes to zero as <m>t \to \infty</m>, as all
			the terms involve an exponential with a negative exponent. So for large <m>t</m>, the
			effect of <m>x_{tr}</m> is negligible and we see essentially only <m>x_{sp}</m>. Hence
			the name <em>transient</em>. Notice that <m>x_{sp}</m> involves no arbitrary constants,
			and the initial conditions only affect <m>x_{tr}</m>. Thus, the effect of the initial
			conditions is negligible after some period of time. We might as well focus on the steady
			periodic solution and ignore the transient solution. See for a graph given several
			different initial conditions. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="mywrapfig"-->
		<p>
			3.25in
		</p><!--</div
		attr= class="mywrapfig">-->

		<p> The speed at which <m>x_{tr}</m> goes to zero depends on <m>p</m> (and hence <m>\gamma</m>).
			The bigger <m>p</m> is (the bigger <m>\gamma</m> is), the <m>x_{tr}</m> becomes
			negligible. So the smaller the damping, the longer the This is consistent with the
			observation that when <m>\gamma=0</m>, the initial conditions affect the behavior for
			all time (i.e. an infinite ). </p>

		<p> Let us describe what we mean by resonance when damping is present. Since there were no
			conflicts when solving with undetermined coefficient, there is no term that goes to
			infinity. We look instead at the maximum value of the amplitude of the steady periodic
			solution. Let <m>C</m> be the amplitude of <m>x_{sp}</m>. If we plot <m>C</m> as a
			function of <m>\omega</m> (with all other parameters fixed), we can find its maximum. We
			call the <m>\omega</m> that achieves this maximum the <em></em>. We call the maximal
			amplitude <m>C(\omega)</m> the <em></em>. Thus when damping is present we talk of <em></em>
			rather than pure resonance. A sample plot for three different values of <m>\gamma</m> is
			given in . As you can see the practical resonance amplitude grows as damping gets
			smaller, and practical resonance can disappear altogether when damping is large. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> The main takeaways from is that the amplitude can be larger than 1, which is the idea of
			resonance in this case. Based on Hooke’s law, we know that a constant force of magnitude <m>
			F_0</m> will stretch (or compress) a spring with constant <m>k</m> a length of <m>F_0/k</m>.
			If we take <m>F_0 = 1</m> and <m>k=1</m>, as is done in , then the resulting magnitude
			should be <m>1</m>. However, if we don’t use a constant force of magnitude <m>F_0</m>,
			but instead use an oscillatory force with frequency <m>\omega</m> of the form <m>F(t) =
			F_0 \cos{(\omega t)}</m>, we get an amplitude of <m>C(\omega)</m>. This graph indicates
			how the forcing frequency changes the amplitude of the resulting oscillation. Since the
			amplitude <q>should</q> be <m>1</m> based on <m>F_0/k</m>, if <m>C(\omega) &gt; 1</m>,
			then the frequency chosen is causing an increase in the amplitude, which is the idea of
			practical resonance. </p>

		<p> To find the maximum, or determine if there is a maximum, we need to find the derivative <m>
			C'(\omega)</m>. Computation shows <me>
				C'(\omega) =
				\frac{- 2\omega( 2p^2+\omega^2-\omega_0^2)F_0}
				{m {\bigl({(2\omega p)}^2+{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)}^2\bigr)}^{3/2}} .
			</me>
			This is zero either when <m>\omega = 0</m> or when <m>2p^2+\omega^2-\omega_0^2 = 0</m>.
			In other words, <m>C'(\omega) = 0</m> when <me>
				\mybxbg{
				~~
				\omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 2p^2} \quad \text{or} \quad \omega = 0 .
				~~
				}
			</me>
			If <m>\omega_0^2 - 2p^2</m> is positive, then there is a positive value of <m>\omega</m>,
			namely <m>\omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 2p^2}</m> where the amplitude attains a maximum
			value. Since we know that the amplitude is <m>F_0/(m\omega_0^2)</m> or <m>F_0/k</m> when <m>\omega
			= 0</m>, the maximum will be larger than this. As described above, this value, <m>F_0/k</m>
			is the expected amplitude, that is, the amplitude you would get with no oscillation, so
			that if the amplitude is larger than this for some value of <m>\omega</m>, this means
			that the oscillation at frequency <m>\omega</m> is resonating with the system to create
			a larger oscillation. This is the idea of <em></em>. It is practical because there is
			damping, so the situation is more physically relevant (to contrast with pure resonance),
			and still results in larger amplitudes of oscillation. </p>

		<p> Our previous work indicates that a system will exhibit practical resonance for some
			values of <m>\omega</m> whenever <m>\omega_0^2 - 2p^2</m> is positive, and the frequency
			where the amplitude hits the maximum value is at <m>\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 2p^2}</m>. This
			follows by the first derivative test for example as then <m>C'(\omega) &gt; 0</m> for
			small <m>\omega</m> in this case. If on the other hand <m>\omega_0^2 - 2p^2</m> is not
			positive, then <m>C(\omega)</m> achieves its maximum at <m>\omega=0</m>, and there is no
			practical resonance since we assume <m>\omega &gt; 0</m> in our system. In this case the
			amplitude gets larger as the forcing frequency gets smaller. </p>

		<p> If practical resonance occurs, the peak frequency is smaller than <m>\omega_0</m>. As
			the damping <m>\gamma</m> (and hence <m>p</m>) becomes smaller, the peak practical
			resonance frequency goes to <m>\omega_0</m>. So when damping is very small, <m>\omega_0</m>
			is a good estimate of the peak practical resonance frequency. This behavior agrees with
			the observation that when <m>\gamma=0</m>, then <m>\omega_0</m> is the resonance
			frequency. </p>

		<p> Another interesting observation to make is that when <m>\omega \to \infty</m>, then <m>C
			\to 0</m>. This means that if the forcing frequency gets too high it does not manage to
			get the mass moving in the mass-spring system. This is quite reasonable intuitively. If
			we wiggle back and forth really fast while sitting on a swing, we will not get it moving
			at all, no matter how forceful. Fast vibrations just cancel each other out before the
			mass has any chance of responding by moving one way or the other. </p>

		<p>
			The behavior is more complicated if the forcing function is not an exact cosine wave,
			but for example a . A general periodic function will be the sum (superposition) of many
			cosine waves of different frequencies. The reader is encouraged to come back to this
			section once we have learned about the ideas of Fourier series.

				<p> A water tower in an earthquake acts as a mass-spring system. Assume that the
					container on top is full and the water does not move around. The container then
					acts as the mass and the support acts as the spring, where the induced
					vibrations are horizontal. The container with water has a mass of <m>
					m=\unit[10,000]{kg}</m>. It takes a force of 1000 newtons to displace the
					container 1 meter. For simplicity assume no friction. When the earthquake hits
					the water tower is at rest (it is not moving). The earthquake induces an
					external force <m>F(t) = m A \omega^2 \cos (\omega t)</m>. </p>

					wave, so simply find the constant in front of the sines. Suppose <m>A = 1</m>
					and an earthquake with frequency 0.5 cycles per second comes. What is the
