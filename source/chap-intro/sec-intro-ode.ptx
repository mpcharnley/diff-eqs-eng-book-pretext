		<title>Differential equations</title>

		<p>
			Consider the following situation:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p> An object falling through the air has its velocity affected by two factors: gravity
				and a drag force. The velocity downward is increased at a rate of <m>9.8\ m/s^2</m>
				due to gravity, and it is decreased by a rate equation to <m>0.3</m> times the
				current velocity of the object. If the ball is initially thrown downwards at a speed
				of <m>2\ m/s</m>, what will the velocity be 10 seconds later? </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p> There might be enough information here to determine the velocity at any later point in
			time (it turns out, there is) but the information given isn’t really about the velocity.
			Rather, information is given about the rate of change of the velocity. We know that the
			velocity will be increased at a rate of <m>9.8 m/s^2</m> due to gravity. How can this be
			interpreted? The rate of change has been discussed previously way back in Calculus 1;
			this is the derivative. Thus, if we let the unknown function <m>v(t)</m> represent the
			velocity of the object, the description above gives information about the derivative of
			this function for<m>v(t)</m>. Taking the two different factors (the increase and
			decrease of velocity) into account, we can write an expression for this derivative,
			giving that <me>
				\frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - 0.3v.
			</me> Even though we don't know what <m>v(t)</m> is, we
			know that it must affect the derivative of the velocity in this particular way, so we
			can write this equation. That’s why we give a name to this function, so that we can use
			it in writing this equestion, which, since it is an equation involving the derivative of
			an unknown function <m>v(t)</m>, we call this a . Our goal here would be to use this
			information, plus the fact that the velocity at time zero is <m>v(0) = 2\ \text{m/s}</m>
			to find the value of <m>v(10)</m>, or, more generally, the function <m>v(t)</m> for any <m>
			t</m>. </p>

		<p>
			The laws of physics, beyond just that of simple velocity, are generally written down as
			differential equations. Therefore, all of science and engineering use differential
			equations to some degree. Understanding differential equations is essential to
			understanding almost anything you will study in your science and engineering classes.
			You can think of mathematics as the language of science, and differential equations are
			one of the most important parts of this language as far as science and engineering are
			concerned. As an analogy, suppose all your classes from now on were given half in
			Swahili and half in English. It would be important to first learn Swahili, or you would
			have a very tough time getting a good grade in your classes. Without it, you might be
			able to make sense of some of what is going on, but would definitely be missing an
			important part of the picture.

		<definition xml:id="def-diffEqn">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>differential equation</term> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
			For a differential equation, the <term>order</term> of the differential equation is the highest
			order derivative that appears in the equation.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p> One example of a first order differential equation is 
			<men xml:id="eq1">
				\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 \cos t
			</men>. Here <m>x</m> is the <term>dependent variable</term> and <m>t</m> is
			the <term>independent variable</term>. Note that we can use any letter we want for the dependent and independent
			variables. This equation arises from Newton's law of cooling where the ambient
			temperature oscillates with time. </p>

		<p> To make sure that everything is well-defined, we will assume that we can always write
			our differential equation with the highest order derivative written as a function of all
			lower derivatives and the independent variable. For the previous example, since we can
			write <xref ref="eq1" /> as <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\cos t - x</me> where the highest
			derivative <m>x'</m> is written as a function of <m>t</m> and <m>x</m>, we have a proper
			differential equation. On the other hand, something like 
			<men xml:id="eqNonDiff">
			\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + y^2 = 1 </men>
			is not a proper differential equation
			because we can't solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m>. This expression could either be written
			as <me>\frac{dy}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \frac{dy}{dt} = -\sqrt{1 -
			y^2},</me> and while both of these are proper differential equations, the version in <xref
				ref="eqNonDiff" /> is not. </p>

		<p> For some equations, like <m>y' = y^2</m>, the independent variable is not explicitly
			stated. We could be looking for a function <m>y(t)</m> or a function <m>y(x)</m> (or <m>
			y</m> of any other variable) and without any other information, any of these is correct.
			Usually, there will be information in the problem statement to indicate that the
			independent variable is something like time, in which case everything should be written
			in terms of <m>t</m>. It is for this reason that Leibniz notation is preferred for
			derivatives; an equation like <me>\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2</me> is unambiguously looking for
			any answer <m>y(t)</m>. </p>


		<example>
		<title> </title>
		<statement>
			<p> All of the below are differential equations <md>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} = e^t y \amp z'' + z^2 = t\sin{z}</mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{d^4f}{dx^4} - 3x \frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = x \amp y''' + (y'')^2 - 3y =
				t^4</mrow>
				</md>.
				Note that any letter can be used for the unknown function and its dependent
				variable. From the context of the equations, we can see that the unknown functions
				we are looking for in these examples are <m>y(t)</m>, <m>z(t)</m>, <m>y(x)</m>, and <m>
				y(t)</m> respectively. The order of these equations are 1, 2, 4, and 3 respectively. </p>
		</statement>

	<subsection xml:id="solutions-of-differential-equations">
		<title>Solutions of differential equations</title>

		<p> Solving the differential equation means finding the function that, when we plug it into
			the differential equation, gives a true statement. For example, take <xref ref="eq1" />
			from the previous section. In this case, this means that we want to find a function of <m>
			t</m>, which we call <m>x</m>, such that when we plug <m>x</m>, <m>t</m>, and <m>
			\frac{dx}{dt}</m> into <xref ref="eq1" />, the equation holds; that is, the left hand
			side equals the right hand side. It is the same idea as it would be for a normal
			(algebraic) equation of just <m>x</m> and <m>t</m>. We claim that <me>
				x = x(t) = \cos t + \sin t
			</me> is a <term>solution</term>. How do we check? We simply plug <m>x</m>
			into equation <xref ref="eq1" />! First we need to compute <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m>. We find
			that <m>\frac{dx}{dt} =
				-\sin t + \cos t</m>. Now let us compute the left-hand side of <xref ref="eq1" />. <me>
			\frac{dx}{dt} + x =
				\underbrace{(-\sin t + \cos t)}_{\frac{dx}{dt}}
				+
				\underbrace{(\cos t + \sin t)}_{x}
				=
				2\cos t .
			</me>
			Yay! We got precisely the right-hand side. But there is more! We claim <m>x = \cos t +
			\sin t + e^{-t}</m> is also a solution. Let us try, <me>
				\frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t + \cos t - e^{-t} .
			</me> We plug into the left-hand side of <xref
				ref="eq1" /> 
<me>
				\frac{dx}{dt} + x =
				\underbrace{(-\sin t + \cos t - e^{-t})}_{\frac{dx}{dt}} +
				\underbrace{(\cos t + \sin t + e^{-t})}_{x}
				= 2\cos t .
			</me>

		</p>

<figure xml:id="intro-plotsfig">
	<caption>Few solutions of <m>\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2\cos{t}</m></caption>
	<image source="intro-plots-alt.png" width="40%">
		<shortdescription>Several oscilatting curves. One starts at 3, one at 1, and one at -1. All of them slowly oscillate to leave the right side of the graph at around -0.7.</shortdescription>
		<description>
			<p>
				Three different solution curves to the differential equation <m>\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2\cos{t}</m> are shown. They all show similar oscillating behavior but start at different points on the <m>y</m> axis. The top one starts at <m>y=3</m>, the second at <m>y=1</m>, and the third at <m>y=-1</m>.

		<p>
			And it works yet again!
		</p>

		<p> So there can be many different solutions. For this equation all solutions can be written
			in the form <me>
				x = \cos t + \sin t + C e^{-t} ,
			</me> for some constant <m>C</m>. Different
			constants <m>C</m> will give different solutions, so there are really infinitely many
			possible solutions. See for the graph of a few of these solutions. We do not yet know
			how to find this solution, but we will get to that in the next chapter. </p>

		<p>
			Solving differential equations can be quite hard. There is no general method that solves
			every differential equation. We will generally focus on how to get exact formulas for
			solutions of certain differential equations, but we will also spend a little bit of time
			on getting approximate solutions. And we will spend some time on understanding the
			equations without solving them.
		</p>

		<p> Most of this book is dedicated to <term>ordinary differential equations</term> or <term>ODEs</term>, that
			is, equations with only one independent variable, where derivatives are only with
			respect to this one variable. If there are several independent variables, we get <term>partial
			differential equations</term> or <term>PDEs</term>. </p>

		<p>
			Even for ODEs, which are very well understood, it is not a simple question of turning a
			crank to get answers. When you can find exact solutions, they are usually preferable to
			approximate solutions. It is important to understand how such solutions are found.
			Although in real applications you will leave much of the actual calculations to
			computers, you need to understand what they are doing. It is often necessary to simplify
			or transform your equations into something that a computer can understand and solve. You
			may even need to make certain assumptions and changes in your model to achieve this.
		</p>

		<p>
			To be a successful engineer or scientist, you will be required to solve problems in your
			job that you have never seen before. It is important to learn problem solving
			techniques, so that you may apply those techniques to new problems. A common mistake is
			to expect to learn some prescription for solving all the problems you will encounter in
			your later career. This course is no exception.

		<title>Differential equations in practice</title>

				<p>
					NEED TO MAKE NEW IMAGE HERE WITH ARROWS
				</p>


		<p> So how do we use differential equations in science and engineering? The main way this
			takes place is through the process of mathematical modeling. First, we have some real-world problem
			we wish to understand. We make some simplifying assumptions and create a <term>mathematical model</term>,
			which is a translation of this real-world problem into a set of differential equations.
			Think back to the example at the beginning of this section. We took a physical situation
			(a falling object) with some knowledge about how it behaves and turned that into a
			differential equation that describes the velocity over time. Then we apply mathematics
			to get some sort of a <term>mathematical solution</term>. Finally, we need to interpret our results, determining
			what this mathematical solution says about the real-world problem we started with. For
			instance, in the example at the start of the section, we could find the function <m>v(t)</m>,
			but then need to interpret that if we were to plug 10 into this function, we will get
			the velocity 10 seconds later. </p>

		<p>
			Learning how to formulate the mathematical model and how to interpret the results is
			what your physics and engineering classes do. In this course, we will focus mostly on
			the mathematical analysis. This will be interspersed with discussions of this modeling
			process to give some context to what we are doing, and give practice for what will be
			seen in future physics and engineering classes.
		</p>

		<p> Let us look at an example of this process. One of the most basic differential equations
			is the standard <term>exponential growth model</term>. Let <m>P</m> denote the population of some bacteria on a
			Petri dish. We assume that there is enough food and enough space. Then the rate of
			growth of bacteria is proportional to the population—a large population grows quicker.
			Let <m>t</m> denote time (say in seconds) and <m>P</m> the population. Our model is <me>
			\frac{dP}{dt} = kP ,
			</me> for some positive constant <m>k &gt; 0</m>. </p>


		<example>
			<title>Bacterial Growth</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose there are 100 bacteria at time 0 and 200 bacteria 10 seconds later. How
					many bacteria will there be 1 minute from time 0 (in 60 seconds)?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p> First we need to solve the equation. We claim that a solution is given by <me>
					P(t) = C e^{kt} ,
					</me> where <m>C</m> is a constant. Let us try: <me>
					\frac{dP}{dt} = C k e^{kt} = k P .
					</me> And it really is a solution. </p>

				<p> OK, now what? We do not know <m>C</m>, and we do not know <m>k</m>. But we know
					something. We know <m>P(0) = 100</m>, and we know <m>P(10) = 200</m>. Let us plug
					these conditions in and see what happens. 
					<md>
						<mrow> 100 \amp = P(0) = C e^{k0} = C </mrow>
						<mrow> 200  \amp = P(10) = 100 \, e^{k10} </mrow>
					</md>.
					 Therefore, <m>2 = e^{10k}</m> or 
					 <m>\frac{\ln 2}{10} = k \approx 0.069</m>. So <me>
						P(t) = 100 \, e^{(\ln 2) t / 10} \approx 100 \, e^{0.069 t}
					</me>.

				</p>

				<figure xml:id="intro-plotbactfig">
					<caption>Bacteria growth in the first 60 seconds.</caption>
					<image source="intro-plotbact.png">
						<shortdescription>Graph showing exponential growth of the population of bacteria, starting at 100 and ending after 60 second at around 6400.</shortdescription>
					</image>
				</figure>

				<p> At one minute, <m>t=60</m>, the population is <m>P(60) = 6400</m>. See . </p>

				<p> Let us talk about the interpretation of the results. Does our solution mean that
					there must be exactly 6400 bacteria on the plate at 60s? No! We made assumptions
					that might not be true exactly, just approximately. If our assumptions are
					reasonable, then there will be approximately 6400 bacteria. Also, in real life <m>
					P</m> is a discrete quantity, not a real number. However, our model has no
					problem saying that for example at 61 seconds, <m>P(61) \approx 6859.35</m>. </p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p> Normally, the <m>k</m> in <m>P' = kP</m> is known, and we want to solve the equation for
			different <term>initial conditions</term>. What does that mean? Take <m>k=1</m> for
			simplicity. Suppose we want to solve the equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = P</m> subject to <m>P(0)
			= 1000</m> (the initial condition). Then the solution turns out to be (exercise) <me>
			P(t) = 1000 \, e^t .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> We call <m>P(t) = C e^t</m> the <term>general solution</term> , as every solution of the equation can be
			written in this form for some constant <m>C</m>. We need an initial condition to find
			out what <m>C</m> is, in order to find the <term>particular solution</term> we are looking for. Generally, when
			we say <q>particular solution</q>, we just mean some solution. </p>

		<title>Four fundamental equations</title>

		<p> A few equations appear often and it is useful to know what their solutions are. Let us
			call them the . Their solutions are reasonably easy to guess by recalling properties of
			exponentials, sines, and cosines. They are also simple to check, which is something that
			you should always do. No need to wonder if you remembered the solution correctly. It is
			good to have these as solutions that you <q>know</q> to build from when we learn
			solutions to other differential equations later on. In <xref ref="fo-chapter"/> we will cover the first two, and
			the last two will be discussed in <xref ref="ho-chapter"/>. </p>

		<p> First such equation is <me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = k y ,
			</me> for some constant <m>k &gt; 0</m>. Here <m>y</m> is the
			dependent and <m>x</m> the independent variable. The general solution for this equation
			is <me>
				y(x) = C e^{kx} .
			</me> We saw above that this function is a solution, although we
			used different variable names. </p>

		<p> Next, <me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = -k y ,
			</me> for some constant <m>k &gt; 0</m>. The general solution
			for this equation is <me>
				y(x) = C e^{-kx} .
			</me>

		</p>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p> Check that the <m>y</m> given is really a solution to the equation. </p>
			</statement>
		</exercise> 

				<p> Next, take the <term>second order equation</term>
					<me>
						\frac{d^2y}{{dx}^2} = -k^2 y ,
					</me> for some constant <m>k &gt; 0</m>. The
					general solution for this equation is <me>
						y(x) = C_1 \cos(kx) + C_2 \sin(kx) .
					</me> Since the equation is a second
					order differential equation, we have two constants in our general solution. </p>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p> Check that the <m>y</m> given is really a solution to the equation. </p>
			</statement>
		</exercise>
				<p> Finally, consider the second order differential equation <me>
						\frac{d^2y}{{dx}^2} = k^2 y ,
					</me> for some constant <m>k &gt; 0</m>. The
					general solution for this equation is <me>
						y(x) = C_1 e^{kx} + C_2 e^{-kx} ,
					</me> or <me>
						y(x) = D_1 \cosh(kx) + D_2 \sinh(kx) .
					</me>

				</p>

		<p> For those that do not know, <m>\cosh</m> and <m>\sinh</m> are defined by <md>
			<mrow> \cosh x = \frac{e^{x} + e^{-x}}{2}\amp \sinh x = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{2}</mrow>
		</md>.
			They are called the <term>hyperbolic cosine</term> and <term>hyperbolic sine</term>. These functions are sometimes easier to
			work with than exponentials. They have some nice familiar properties such as <m>\cosh 0
			= 1</m>, <m>\sinh 0 = 0</m>, and <m>\frac{d}{dx} \cosh x = \sinh x</m> (no that is not a

		<example>

		<statement>
			<p> In equations of higher order, you get more constants you must solve for to get a
