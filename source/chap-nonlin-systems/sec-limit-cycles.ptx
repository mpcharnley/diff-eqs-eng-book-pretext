	<title>Limit cycles</title>

	<p>
		For nonlinear systems, trajectories do not simply need to approach or leave a single point.
		They may in fact approach a larger set, such as a circle or another closed curve.
	</p>


	<example>
	<title> </title>
	<statement>
		<p> The <em></em><fn>
				 Named for the Dutch physicist <url
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balthasar_van_der_Pol">Balthasar van der
			Pol</url> (1889–1959). 
			</fn> is the following equation <me>
			x''-\mu(1-x^2) x' + x = 0,
			</me> where <m>\mu</m> is some positive constant. The Van
			der Pol oscillator originated with electrical circuits, but finds applications in
			diverse fields such as biology, seismology, and other physical sciences. </p>

		<p> For simplicity, let us use <m>\mu = 1</m>. A phase diagram is given in the left-hand
			plot in . Notice how the trajectories seem to very quickly settle on a closed curve. On
			the right-hand side is the plot of a single solution for <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=30</m> with
			initial conditions <m>x(0) = 0.1</m> and <m>x'(0) = 0.1</m>. The solution quickly tends
			to a periodic solution. </p>

		<p> The Van der Pol oscillator is an example of so-called <em></em>. The word relaxation
			comes from the sudden jump (the very steep part of the solution). For larger <m>\mu</m>
			the steep part becomes even more pronounced, for small <m>\mu</m> the limit cycle looks
			more like a circle. In fact, setting <m>\mu = 0</m>, we get <m>x''+x=0</m>, which is a
			linear system with a center and all trajectories become circles. </p>
	</statement>
</example>
	<p> What we see in this example is a curve to which many solution seem to head towards as <m>t</m>
		gets larger. This motivates the following definition. </p>

	<!-- div attr= class="definition"-->
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p> A trajectory in the phase portrait that is a closed curve (a curve that is a
					loop) is called a <em></em>. </p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p> A <em></em> is a closed trajectory such that at least one other trajectory
					spirals into it. </p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p> If all trajectories that start near the limit cycle spiral into it, the limit
					cycle is called <em>asymptotically stable</em>. </p>
			</li>

		</ol>
	</p><!--</div
	attr= class="definition">-->

	<p>
		For example, the closed curve in the phase portrait for the Van der Pol equation is a limit
		cycle, and the limit cycle in the Van der Pol oscillator is asymptotically stable.
	</p>

	<p> Given a closed trajectory on an autonomous system, any solution that starts on it is
		periodic. Such a curve is called a <em></em>. More precisely, if <m>\bigl(x(t),y(t)\bigr)</m>
		is a solution such that for some <m>t_0</m> the point <m>\bigl(x(t_0),y(t_0)\bigr)</m> lies
		on a periodic orbit, then both <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> are periodic functions (with the
		same period). That is, there is some number <m>P</m> such that <m>x(t) = x(t+P)</m> and <m>y(t)
		= y(t+P)</m>. </p>

	<p>
		We would like to be able to identify when these sorts of periodic orbits can or can’t happen
		to understand more about these systems. Thankfully, we have a theorem that gives us some
		help here.
	</p>

	<!-- div attr= class="theorem1"-->
	<p> Poincaré–Bendixson Consider the system <men xml:id="nlin-gensys">
			x' = f(x,y), \qquad y' = g(x,y) ,
		</men> where the functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have
		continuous derivatives in some region <m>R</m> in the plane. </p>

	<p> Suppose <m>R</m> is a closed bounded region (a region in the plane that includes its
		boundary and does not have points arbitrarily far from the origin). Suppose <m>\bigl(x(t),
		y(t)\bigr)</m> is a solution of <xref ref="nlin-gensys" /> in <m>R</m> that exists for all <m>t
		\geq t_0</m>. Then either the solution is a periodic function, or the solution tends towards
		a periodic solution in <m>R</m>. </p><!--</div
	attr= class="theorem1">-->

	<p> The main point of the theorem<fn>
			
				<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Otto_Bendixson">Ivar Otto Bendixson</url>
		(1861–1935) was a Swedish mathematician. 
		</fn> is that if you find one solution
		that exists for all <m>t</m> large enough (that is, as <m>t</m> goes to infinity) and stays
		within a bounded region, then you have found either a periodic orbit, or a solution that
		spirals towards a limit cycle or tends to a critical point. That is, in the long term, the
		behavior is very close to a periodic function. Note that a constant solution at a critical
		point is periodic (with any period). The theorem is more a qualitative statement rather than
		something to help us in computations. In practice it is hard to find analytic solutions and
		so hard to show rigorously that they exist for all time. But if we think the solution exists
		we numerically solve for a large time to approximate the limit cycle. Another caveat is that
		the theorem only works in two dimensions. In three dimensions and higher, there is simply
		too much room. </p>

	<p> The theorem applies to all solutions in the Van der Pol oscillator. Solutions that start at
		any point except the origin <m>(0,0)</m> will tend to the periodic solution around the limit
		cycle, and if the initial condition of <m>(0,0)</m> will lead to the constant solution <m>
		x=0</m>, <m>y=0</m>. </p>


	<example>
		<title> </title>
		<statement>
			<p> Consider <me>
					x' = y + {(x^2+y^2-1)}^2 x, \qquad
					y' = -x + {(x^2+y^2-1)}^2 y.
				</me> A vector
				field along with solutions with initial conditions <m>(1.02,0)</m>, <m>(0.9,0)</m>,
				and <m>(0.1,0)</m> are drawn in . Analyze this system to determine what will happen
				to the solution for a variety of initial conditions. </p>

			<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
			<!--</div
			attr= class="myfig">-->
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p> Notice that points on the unit circle (distance one from the origin) satisfy <m>
				x^2+y^2-1=0</m>. And <m>x(t) = \sin(t)</m>, <m>y = \cos(t)</m> is a solution of the
				system. Therefore we have a closed trajectory. For points off the unit circle, the
				second term in <m>x'</m> pushes the solution further away from the <m>y</m>-axis
				than the system <m>x' = y</m>, <m>y' = -x</m>, and <m>y'</m> pushes the solution
				further away from the <m>x</m>-axis than the linear system <m>x'=y</m>, <m>y' = -x</m>.
				In other words for all other initial conditions the trajectory will spiral out. </p>

			<p>
				This means that for initial conditions inside the unit circle, the solution spirals
				out towards the periodic solution on the unit circle, and for initial conditions
				outside the unit circle the solutions spiral off towards infinity. Therefore the
				unit circle is a limit cycle, but not an asymptotically stable one. In relation to
				the terms used for autonomous equations in , we could refer to this as a semistable
				limit cycle, since on one side (inside) the solutions spiral towards the periodic
				orbit, while on the other side (outside) the solutions move away. The
				Poincaré–Bendixson Theorem applies to the initial points inside the unit circle, as
				those solutions stay bounded, but not to those outside, as those solutions go off to
				infinity.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p> A very similar analysis applies to the system <me>
			x' = y + {(x^2+y^2-1)} x, \qquad
			y' = -x + {(x^2+y^2-1)} y.
		</me> We still obtain a
		closed trajectory on the unit circle, and points outside the unit circle spiral out to
		infinity, but now points inside the unit circle spiral towards the critical point at the
		origin. So this system does not have a limit cycle, even though it has a closed trajectory. </p>

	<p> One way to see this more explicitly is by trying to write this all in terms of <me>r =
		\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.</me> For simplicity here, we will determine everything in terms of <me>s =
		r^2 = x^2 + y^2</me> because as long as <m>r &gt; 0</m>, <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> always have
		the same behavior (in terms of increasing and decreasing), and it is easier to compute with <m>
		s</m>. </p>

	<p> Using the first example <me>
			x' = y + {(x^2+y^2-1)}^2 x, \qquad
			y' = -x + {(x^2+y^2-1)}^2 y.
		</me> we see that <me>\begin{split}
		s' &amp;= 2xx' + 2yy' \\
			&amp;= 2x(y + {(x^2+y^2-1)}^2 x + 2y(-x + {(x^2+y^2-1)}^2 y) \\
			&amp;= 2xy + 2x^2(x^2 + y^2 - 1)^2 - 2xy + 2y^2(x^2 + y^2 - 1)^2 \\
			s' &amp;= 2s(s-1)^2
			\end{split}</me>
	</p>

	<p> Thus, we are left with the equation <me>\frac{ds}{dt} = 2s(s-1)^2</me> which is an
		autonomous first-order equation that we can analyze. We have two equilibrium solutions in
		terms of <m>s</m> at <m>s=0</m>, which corresponds to the origin, and <m>s=1</m>, which
		corresponds to the unit circle. We can then plug in values to see that for <m>s =
		\frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{ds}{dt} &gt; 0</m>, so that the solutions will increase out to the
		unit circle. For <m>s&gt;1</m>, <m>\frac{ds}{dt} &gt; 0</m> as well, so solutions move away
		from the circle outside it. This is the same as the result we obtained in the first example. </p>

	<p> For the second example, we end up with the autonomous equation <me>\frac{ds}{dt} = 2s(s-1)</me>
		which is negative for <m>0 &lt; s &lt; 1</m> and positive for <m>1 &lt; s</m>, giving that
		solutions that start inside the unit circle will converge to the origin, and solutions that
		start outside the circle will move away from it. </p>

	<p> Due to the Picard theorem () we find that no matter where we are in the plane we can always
		find a solution a little bit further in time, as long as <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have
		continuous derivatives. So if we find a closed trajectory in an autonomous system, then for
		every initial point inside the closed trajectory, the solution will exist for all time and
		it will stay bounded (it will stay inside the closed trajectory). Since the closed
		trajectory is a solution, we can not cross it (by Picard theorem), and so we have to stay
		trapped inside. So the moment we found the solution above going around the unit circle, we
		knew that for every initial point inside the circle, the solution exists for all time and
		the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem applies. </p>

	<p> Let us next look for conditions when limit cycles (or periodic orbits) do not exist. We
		assume the equation <xref ref="nlin-gensys" /> is defined on a <em></em>, that is, a region
		with no holes we can go around. For example the entire plane is a simply connected region,
		and so is the inside of the unit disc. However, the entire plane minus a point is not a
		simply connected domain as it has a at the origin. </p>

	<!-- div attr= class="theorem1"-->
	<p> Bendixson–Dulac Suppose <m>R</m> is a simply connected region, and the expression <fn>
			 Usually the expression in the Bendixson–Dulac Theorem is <m>\frac{\partial (\varphi
		f)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (\varphi
					g)}{\partial y}</m> for some continuously differentiable function <m>\varphi</m>.
		For simplicity, let us just consider the case <m>\varphi = 1</m>. 
		</fn> 
<me>
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}
		</me> is either always
		positive or always negative on <m>R</m> (except perhaps a small set such as on isolated
		points or curves) then the system <xref ref="nlin-gensys" /> has no closed trajectory inside <m>
		R</m>. </p><!--</div
	attr= class="theorem1">-->

	<p> The theorem<fn>
			
				<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Dulac">Henri Dulac</url> (1870–1955)
		was a French mathematician. 
		</fn> gives us a way of ruling out the existence of
		a closed trajectory, and hence a way of ruling out limit cycles. The exception about points
		or curves means that we can allow the expression to be zero at a few points, or perhaps on a
		curve, but not on any larger set. </p>


	<example>
		<title> </title>
		<statement>
			<p> Let us look at <m>x'=y+y^2e^x</m>, <m>y'=x</m> in the entire plane (see ) and try to
				apply . </p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p> The entire plane is simply connected and so we can apply the theorem. We compute <m>\frac{\partial
				f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} =
					y^2e^x+ 0</m>. The function <m>y^2e^x</m> is always positive except on the line <m>
				y=0</m>. Therefore, via the theorem, the system has no closed trajectories. </p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p> In some books (or the internet) the theorem is not stated carefully and it concludes there
		are no periodic solutions. That is not quite right. The example above has two critical
		points and hence it has constant solutions, and constant functions are periodic. The
		conclusion of the theorem should be that there exist no trajectories that form closed
		curves. Another way to state the conclusion of the theorem would be to say that there exist
		no nonconstant periodic solutions that stay in <m>R</m>. </p>

	<p>
		Let us look at a somewhat more complicated example.
	</p>


	<example>
		<title> </title>
		<statement>
			<p> Take the system <m>x'=-y-x^2</m>, <m>y'=-x+y^2</m> (see ) and look at how works
				here. </p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p> We compute <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} =
					-2x + 2y=2(-x+y)</m>. This expression takes on both signs, so if we are talking
				about the whole plane we cannot simply apply the theorem. However, we could apply it
				on the set where <m>-x+y \geq 0</m>. Via the theorem, there is no closed trajectory
				in that set. Similarly, there is no closed trajectory in the set <m>-x+y \leq 0</m>.
				We cannot conclude (yet) that there is no closed trajectory in the entire plane.
				Perhaps half of it is in the set where <m>-x+y \geq 0</m> and the other half is in
				the set where <m>-x+y \leq 0</m>. </p>

			<p> The key is to look at the line where <m>-x+y=0</m>, or <m>x=y</m>. On this line <m>x'
				= -y-x^2 = -x-x^2</m> and <m>y' = -x+y^2 = -x+x^2</m>. In particular, when <m>x=y</m>
				then <m>x' \leq y'</m>. That means that the arrows, the vectors <m>(x',y')</m>,
				always point into the set where <m>-x+y \geq 0</m>. There is no way we can start in
				the set where <m>-x+y \geq 0</m> and go into the set where <m>-x+y \leq 0</m>. Once
				we are in the set where <m>-x+y \geq 0</m>, we stay there. So no closed trajectory
				can have points in both sets. </p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<title> </title>
		<statement>
			<p> Consider <m>x' = y+(x^2+y^2-1)x</m>, <m>y' = -x +(x^2+y^2-1)y</m>, and consider the
				region <m>R</m> given by <m>x^2+y^2 &gt;
					\frac{1}{2}</m>. That is, <m>R</m> is the region outside a circle of radius <m>
				\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m> centered at the origin. Then there is a closed trajectory in <m>
				R</m>, namely <m>x=\cos(t)</m>, <m>y=\sin(t)</m>. Furthermore, <me>
					\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} +
					\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 4x^2+4y^2-2 ,
				</me>
				which is always positive on <m>R</m>. So what is going on? The Bendixson–Dulac
				theorem does not apply since the region <m>R</m> is not simply connected—it has a
				hole, the circle we cut out! </p>
