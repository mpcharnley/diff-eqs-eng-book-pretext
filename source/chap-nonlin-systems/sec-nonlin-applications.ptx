	<title>Applications of nonlinear systems</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			In this section we study two very standard examples of nonlinear systems. First, we look
			at the nonlinear pendulum equation. We saw the pendulum equationâ€™s linearization before,
			but we noted it was only valid for small angles and short times. Now we find out what
			happens for large angles. Next, we look at the predator-prey equation, which finds
			various applications in modeling problems in biology, chemistry, economics, and
			elsewhere.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection xml:id="pendulum">
		<title>Pendulum</title>

		<p> The first example we study is the pendulum equation <m>\theta''+\frac{g}{L} \sin \theta
			= 0</m>. Here, <m>\theta</m> is the angular displacement, <m>g</m> is the gravitational
			acceleration, and <m>L</m> is the length of the pendulum. In this equation we disregard
			friction, so we are talking about an idealized pendulum. </p>

		attr= class="mywrapfigsimp">-->

		<p> This equation is a conservative equation, so we can use our analysis of conservative
			equations from the previous section. Let us change the equation to a two-dimensional
			system in variables <m>(\theta,\omega)</m> by introducing the new variable <m>\omega</m>
			: 
<me>
				\begin{bmatrix}
				\theta \\ \omega
				\end{bmatrix} '
				=
				\begin{bmatrix}
				\omega \\
				- \frac{g}{L} \sin \theta
				\end{bmatrix} .
			</me>
			The critical points of this system are when <m>\omega = 0</m> and <m>-\frac{g}{L}
				\sin \theta = 0</m>, or in other words if <m>\sin \theta = 0</m>. So the critical
			points are when <m>\omega = 0</m> and <m>\theta</m> is a multiple of <m>\pi</m>. That
			is, the points are <m>\ldots (-2\pi,0), (-\pi,0), (0,0), (\pi,0), (2\pi,0)
				\ldots</m>. While there are infinitely many critical points, they are all isolated.
			Let us compute the Jacobian matrix: <me>
				\begin{bmatrix}
				\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \Bigl( \omega \Bigr) &amp;
				\frac{\partial}{\partial \omega} \Bigl( \omega \Bigr) \\
				\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \Bigl( - \frac{g}{L} \sin \theta \Bigr) &amp;
			\frac{\partial}{\partial \omega} \Bigl( - \frac{g}{L} \sin \theta \Bigr)
				\end{bmatrix}
				=
				\begin{bmatrix}
				0 &amp; 1 \\
				- \frac{g}{L} \cos \theta &amp; 0
				\end{bmatrix} .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> For conservative equations, there are two types of critical points. Either stable
			centers, or saddle points. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are <m>\lambda = \pm
			\sqrt{-\frac{g}{L}\cos \theta}</m>. </p>

		<p> The eigenvalues are going to be real when <m>\cos \theta &lt; 0</m>. This happens at the
			odd multiples of <m>\pi</m>. The eigenvalues are going to be purely imaginary when <m>\cos
			\theta &gt; 0</m>. This happens at the even multiples of <m>\pi</m>. Therefore the
			system has a stable center at the points <m>\ldots (-2\pi,0), (0,0), (2\pi,0) \ldots</m>,
			and it has an unstable saddle at the points <m>\ldots (-3\pi,0), (-\pi,0), (\pi,0),
			(3\pi,0) \ldots</m>. Look at the phase diagram in , where for simplicity we let <m>\frac{g}{L}
			= 1</m>. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> Since this is a pendulum without friction, we can characterize the two differnet types
			of trajectories here. There are the curves running along the top and bottom of the phase
			portrait that look somewhat like sine waves. These graphs never cross the <m>x</m>-axis,
			which is the line <m>\omega = 0</m>. Therefore, these are trajectories where the
			pendulum never stops moving; it just keeps spinning around in full circles forever,
			crossing through all possible values of <m>\theta</m>. The other type of trajectory are
			the ellipses around each of the stable equilibrium solutions. In these cases, the graph
			only spans a specific range of <m>\theta</m> values, represented by the reduced <m>x</m>
			range of the ellipse, and cycles there forever. This represents a pendulum that does not
			have enough energy to make a full circle, and just oscillates back-and-forth to a fixed
			height forever. </p>

		<p> In the linearized equation we have only a single critical point, the center at <m>(0,0)</m>.
			Now we see more clearly what we meant when we said the linearization is good for small
			angles. The horizontal axis is the deflection angle. The vertical axis is the angular
			velocity of the pendulum. Suppose we start at <m>\theta = 0</m> (no deflection), and we
			start with a small angular velocity <m>\omega</m>. Then the trajectory keeps going
			around the critical point <m>(0,0)</m> in an approximate circle. This corresponds to
			short swings of the pendulum back and forth. When <m>\theta</m> stays small, the
			trajectories really look like circles and hence are very close to our linearization. </p>

		<p> When we give the pendulum a big enough push, it goes across the top and keeps spinning
			about its axis. This behavior corresponds to the wavy curves that do not cross the
			horizontal axis in the phase diagram. Let us suppose we look at the top curves, when the
			angular velocity <m>\omega</m> is large and positive. Then the pendulum is going around
			and around its axis. The velocity is going to be large when the pendulum is near the
			bottom, and the velocity is the smallest when the pendulum is close to the top of its
			loop. </p>

		<p> At each critical point, there is an equilibrium solution. Consider the solution <m>\theta
			= 0</m>; the pendulum is not moving and is hanging straight down. This is a stable place
			for the pendulum to be, hence this is a <em>stable</em> equilibrium. </p>

		<p> The other type of equilibrium solution is at the unstable point, for example <m>\theta =
			\pi</m>. Here the pendulum is upside down. Sure you can balance the pendulum this way
			and it will stay, but this is an <em>unstable</em> equilibrium. Even the tiniest push
			will make the pendulum start swinging wildly. </p>

		<p> See for a diagram. The first picture is the stable equilibrium <m>\theta = 0</m>. The
			second picture corresponds to those in the phase diagram around <m>\theta =0</m> when
			the angular velocity is small. The next picture is the unstable equilibrium <m>\theta =
			\pi</m>. The last picture corresponds to the wavy lines for large angular velocities. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> The quantity <me>
				\frac{1}{2} \omega^2 - \frac{g}{L} \cos \theta
			</me> is conserved by any solution.
			This is the energy or the Hamiltonian of the system. </p>

		<p> We have a conservative equation and so (exercise) the trajectories are given by <me>
			\omega = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{2g}{L} \cos \theta + C} ,
			</me> for various values of <m>C</m>.
			Let us look at the initial condition of <m>(\theta_0,0)</m>, that is, we take the
			pendulum to angle <m>\theta_0</m>, and just let it go (initial angular velocity 0). We
			plug the initial conditions into the above and solve for <m>C</m> to obtain <me>
				C = - \frac{2g}{L} \cos \theta_0 .
			</me> Thus the expression for the trajectory is <me>
			\omega = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{2g}{L}} \sqrt{ \cos \theta - \cos \theta_0 } .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> Let us figure out the period. That is, the time it takes for the pendulum to swing back
			and forth. We notice that the trajectory about the origin in the phase plane is
			symmetric about both the <m>\theta</m> and the <m>\omega</m>-axis. That is, in terms of <m>
			\theta</m>, the time it takes from <m>\theta_0</m> to <m>-\theta_0</m> is the same as it
			takes from <m>-\theta_0</m> back to <m>\theta_0</m>. Furthermore, the time it takes from <m>
			-\theta_0</m> to <m>0</m> is the same as to go from <m>0</m> to <m>\theta_0</m>.
			Therefore, let us find how long it takes for the pendulum to go from angle 0 to angle <m>
			\theta_0</m>, which is a quarter of the full oscillation and then multiply by 4. </p>

		<p> We figure out this time by finding <m>\frac{dt}{d\theta}</m> and integrating from <m>0</m>
			to <m>\theta_0</m>. The period is four times this integral. Let us stay in the region
			where <m>\omega</m> is positive. Since <m>\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}</m>, inverting we
			get <me>
				\frac{dt}{d\theta} = \sqrt{\frac{L}{2g}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\cos \theta - \cos \theta_0
			}} .
			</me>
			Therefore the period <m>T</m> is given by <me>
				T = 4 \sqrt{\frac{L}{2g}} \int_0^{\theta_0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\cos \theta -
				\cos \theta_0 }}\, d\theta .
			</me>
			The integral is an improper integral, and we cannot in general evaluate it symbolically.
			We must resort to numerical approximation if we want to compute a particular <m>T</m>. </p>

		<p> Recall from , the linearized equation <m>\theta''+\frac{g}{L}\theta
				= 0</m> has period <me>
				T_{\text{linear}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} .
			</me> We plot <m>T</m>, <m>
			T_{\text{linear}}</m>, and the relative error <m>\frac{T-T_{\text{linear}}}{T}</m> in .
			The relative error says how far is our approximation from the real period
			percentage-wise. Note that <m>T_{\text{linear}}</m> is simply a constant, it does not
			change with the initial angle <m>\theta_0</m>. The actual period <m>T</m> gets larger
			and larger as <m>\theta_0</m> gets larger. Notice how the relative error is small when <m>
			\theta_0</m> is small. It is still only <m>15\%</m> when <m>\theta_0 = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
			that is, a 90 degree angle. The error is <m>3.8\%</m> when starting at <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m>,
			a 45 degree angle. At a 5 degree initial angle, the error is only <m>0.048 \%</m>. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> While it is not immediately obvious from the formula, it is true that <me>
				\lim_{\theta_0 \uparrow \pi} T = \infty .
			</me> That is, the period goes to infinity
			as the initial angle approaches the unstable equilibrium point. So if we put the
			pendulum almost upside down it may take a very long time before it gets down. This is
			consistent with the limiting behavior, where the exactly upside down pendulum never
			makes an oscillation, so we could think of that as infinite period. </p>

	<subsection xml:id="predator-prey-or-lotkavolterra-systems">
		<title>Predator-prey or Lotkaâ€“Volterra systems</title>

		<p> One of the most common simple applications of nonlinear systems are the so-called <em></em>
			or <em></em> <fn>
				 Named for the American mathematician, chemist, and statistician <url
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_J._Lotka">Alfred James Lotka</url>
			(1880â€“1949) and the Italian mathematician and physicist <url
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Volterra">Vito Volterra</url>
			(1860â€“1940). 
			</fn> systems. For example, these systems arise when two
			species interact, one as the prey and one as the predator. It is then no surprise that
			the equations also see applications in economics. The system also arises in chemical
			reactions. In biology, this system of equations explains the natural periodic variations
			of populations of different species in nature. Before the application of differential
			equations, these periodic variations in the population baffled biologists. </p>

		<p> We keep with the classical example of hares and foxes in a forest, it is the easiest to
			understand. <me>
				\begin{aligned}
				&amp; x = \# \text{ of hares (the prey),} \\
				&amp; y = \# \text{ of foxes (the predator).}
				\end{aligned}
			</me>
			When there are a lot of hares, there is plenty of food for the foxes, so the fox
			population grows. However, when the fox population grows, the foxes eat more hares, so
			when there are lots of foxes, the hare population should go down, and vice versa. The
			Lotkaâ€“Volterra model proposes that this behavior is described by the system of equations <me>
			\begin{aligned}
				&amp; x' = (a-by)x, \\
				&amp; y' = (cx-d)y,
				\end{aligned}
			</me>
			where <m>a,b,c,d</m> are some parameters that describe the interaction of the foxes and
			hares<fn>
				
					This interaction does not end well for the hare.
				
			</fn>. In
			this model, these are all positive numbers. </p>

		<p> Let us analyze the idea behind this model. The model is a slightly more complicated idea
			based on the exponential population model. First expand, <me>
				x' = (a-by)x = ax - byx .
			</me> The hares are expected to simply grow exponentially
			in the absence of foxes, that is where the <m>ax</m> term comes in, the growth in
			population is proportional to the population itself. We are assuming the hares always
			find enough food and have enough space to reproduce. However, there is another component <m>
			-byx</m>, that is, the population also is decreasing proportionally to the number of
			foxes. Together we can write the equation as <m>(a-by)x</m>, so it is like exponential
			growth or decay but the constant depends on the number of foxes. </p>

		<p> The equation for foxes is very similar, expand again <me>
				y' = (cx-d)y = cxy-dy .
			</me> The foxes need food (hares) to reproduce: the more
			food, the bigger the rate of growth, hence the <m>cxy</m> term. On the other hand, there
			are natural deaths in the fox population, and hence the <m>-dy</m> term. </p>

		<p> Without further delay, let us start with an explicit example. Suppose the equations are <me>
			x' = (0.4-0.01y)x, \qquad y' = (0.003x-0.3)y .
			</me> See for the phase portrait. In
			this example it makes sense to also plot <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as graphs with respect to
			time. Therefore the second graph in is the graph of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> on the
			vertical axis (the prey <m>x</m> is the thinner blue line with taller peaks), against
			time on the horizontal axis. The particular solution graphed was with initial conditions
			of 20 foxes and 50 hares. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> Let us analyze what we see on the graphs. We work in the general setting rather than
			putting in specific numbers. We start with finding the critical points. Set <m>(a-by)x =
			0</m>, and <m>(cx-d)y = 0</m>. The first equation is satisfied if either <m>x=0</m> or <m>
			y=\nicefrac{a}{b}</m>. If <m>x=0</m>, the second equation implies <m>y=0</m>. If <m>y=
			\nicefrac{a}{b}</m>, the second equation implies <m>x=\nicefrac{d}{c}</m>. There are two
			equilibria: at <m>(0,0)</m> when there are no animals at all, and at <m>
			(\nicefrac{d}{c},\nicefrac{a}{b})</m>. In our specific example <m>x = \nicefrac{d}{c} =
			100</m>, and <m>y = \nicefrac{a}{b} = 40</m>. This is the point where there are 100
			hares and 40 foxes. </p>

		<p> We compute the Jacobian matrix: <me>
				\begin{bmatrix}
				a-by &amp; -bx \\
				cy &amp; cx-d
				\end{bmatrix} .
			</me> At the
			origin <m>(0,0)</m> we get the matrix <m>\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}
				a &amp; 0 \\
				0 &amp; -d
				\end{smallmatrix} \right]</m>, so the eigenvalues are <m>a</m> and <m>-d</m>, hence
			real and of opposite signs. So the critical point at the origin is a saddle. This makes
			sense. If you started with some foxes but no hares, then the foxes would go extinct,
			that is, you would approach the origin. If you started with no foxes and a few hares,
			then the hares would keep multiplying without check, and so you would go away from the
			origin. </p>

		<p> OK, how about the other critical point at <m>(\nicefrac{d}{c},\nicefrac{a}{b})</m>. Here
			the Jacobian matrix becomes <me>
				\begin{bmatrix}
				0 &amp; -\frac{bd}{c} \\
				\frac{ac}{b} &amp; 0
				\end{bmatrix} .
			</me>
			The eigenvalues satisfy <m>\lambda^2 + ad = 0</m>. In other words, <m>\lambda = \pm i
			\sqrt{ad}</m>. The eigenvalues being purely imaginary, we are in the case where we
			cannot quite decide using only linearization. We could have a stable center, spiral
			sink, or a spiral source. That is, the equilibrium could be asymptotically stable,
			stable, or unstable. Of course I gave you a picture above that seems to imply it is a
			stable center. But never trust a picture only. Perhaps the oscillations are getting
			larger and larger, but only <em>very</em> slowly. Of course this would be bad as it
			would imply something will go wrong with our population sooner or later. And I only
			graphed a very specific example with very specific trajectories. </p>

		<p> How can we be sure we are in the stable situation? As we said before, in the case of
			purely imaginary eigenvalues, we have to do a bit more work. The main approach that can
			be used here is to directly solve for the trajectories. We can determine a differential
			equation that relates <m>x</m> to <m>y</m> by writing <me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} = \frac{(cx-d)y}{(a-by)x}.
			</me> This is a
			separable first order equation, which we can rewrite as <me>
				\frac{a-by}{y} dy = \frac{cx-d}{x} dx.
			</me> After simplifying the fractions, we can
			integrate this to obtain the implicit solution <me>
				a\ln(y) - by = cx - d\ln(x) + C
			</me> or <men xml:id="eq-predPreyTraj">
				C = a\ln(y) + d\ln(x) - cx - by.
			</men> Since we ended up finding a trajectory here
			that sketches out a closed curve, and we know that our solutions must lie on these
			trajectories, that tells us that, for a fact, we do have closed loops here, and the
			critical point is stable. </p>

		<p> However, we can go a bit farther than this with our discussion here. If we let <m>D =
			e^C</m> in <xref ref="eq-predPreyTraj" />, we can rearrange the expression to get that <me>
			D = \frac{y^a x^d}{e^{cx+by}} = y^a x^d e^{-cx-by},
			</me> and based on how our
			trajectory setup works, we know that this <m>D</m> will be conserved along the flow of
			the solution. That is, if the initial condition has a specific value of <m>D</m>, the
			solution will continue to have that same value for all <m>t</m>. This idea came up
			before in the idea of conservative or Hamiltonian systems in . Such a quantity is called
			the <em></em>, and this forces the trajectory to go in closed loops. Let us check <m>D</m>
			really is a constant of motion. How do we check, you say? Well, a constant is something
			that does not change with time, so let us compute the derivative with respect to time: <me>
			D' =
				a y^{a-1}y' x^d e^{-cx-by}
				+
				y^a d x^{d-1} x' e^{-cx-by}
				+
				y^a x^d e^{-cx-by} (-cx'-by') .
			</me>
			Our equations give us what <m>x'</m> and <m>y'</m> are so let us plug those in: <me>
			\begin{split}
				D' &amp; =
				a y^{a-1} (cx-d)y x^d e^{-cx-by}
				+
				y^a d x^{d-1} (a-by)x e^{-cx-by}
				\\
				&amp; \phantom{mm} +
				y^a x^d e^{-cx-by} \bigl(-c(a-by)x-b(cx-d)y\bigr)
				\\
				&amp; =
				y^a x^d e^{-cx-by}
				\Bigl(
				a (cx-d)
				+
				d (a-by)
				+
				\bigl(-c(a-by)x-b(cx-d)y\bigr) \Bigr)
				\\
				&amp; =
				0 .
				\end{split}
			</me>
			So along the trajectories <m>D</m> is constant. In fact, the expression <m>D =
				\frac{y^a x^d}{e^{cx+by}}</m> gives us an implicit equation for the trajectories. In
			any case, once we have found this constant of motion, it must be true that the
			trajectories are simple curves, that is, the level curves of <m>\frac{y^a
			x^d}{e^{cx+by}}</m>. It turns out, the critical point at <m>
			(\nicefrac{d}{c},\nicefrac{a}{b})</m> is a maximum for <m>D</m> (left as an exercise).
			So <m>(\nicefrac{d}{c},\nicefrac{a}{b})</m> is a stable equilibrium point, and we do not
			have to worry about the foxes and hares going extinct or their populations exploding. </p>

		<p>
			One blemish on this wonderful model is that the number of foxes and hares are discrete
			quantities and we are modeling with continuous variables. Our model has no problem with
			there being 0.1 fox in the forest for example, while in reality that makes no sense. The
			approximation is a reasonable one as long as the number of foxes and hares are large,
			but it does not make much sense for small numbers. One must be careful in interpreting
			any results from such a model.
		</p>

		<p>
			An interesting consequence (perhaps counterintuitive) of this model is that adding
			animals to the forest might lead to extinction, because the variations will get too big,
			and one of the populations will get close to zero. For example, suppose there are 20
			foxes and 50 hares as before, but now we bring in more foxes, bringing their number to
			200. If we run the computation, we find the number of hares will plummet to just
			slightly more than 1 hare in the whole forest. In reality that most likely means the
			hares die out, and then the foxes will die out as well as they will have nothing to eat.

		<example>
			<title> </title>
			<statement>
				<p> Consider the system <me>
						x' = (2y - 6)x \qquad y' = (2 - x)y.
					</me> This fits the description of a
					predator-prey model. Which species is the predator? Find and analyze the
					critical points of this system, and draw a sketch of the phase portrait, with
					arrows to indicate the direction of flow around this portrait. </p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p> If we expand out the equations in the model, we get <me>
						x' = 2xy - 6x \qquad y' = 2y - xy.
					</me> These equations show that, if <m>y=0</m>
					, <m>x</m> would decay away in time, and if <m>x=0</m>, <m>y</m> would grow
					indefinitely. This means that <m>x</m> is the predator and <m>y</m> is the prey
					in this relationship. For critical points, we can look back at the factored
					version of the equations to see that we get one critical point at <m>(0,0)</m>
					and one critical point at <m>(2, 3)</m>. Since this is a predator-prey model, we
					know that we will have cycles around the critical point at <m>(2,3)</m>. </p>

				<p> The direction of these cycles is determined by the predator-prey relationship.
					If we start with <m>x</m> large (greater than 2) and <m>y</m> small (less than
					3), then there are a lot of predators and few prey. This implies that the next
					thing to happen is that the predator population will decrease because there is
					not enough prey. We can also see this from the equations; if <m>x \geq 2</m> and <m>y
					\leq 3</m>, then both <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> will be
					negative. Similarly, if <m>y</m> is large and <m>x</m> is small, there are a lot
					of prey and few predators, so the prey population will continue to grow, while
					the predators also grow because of the excess of food. This means that the
					populations will follow these trajectories in a clockwise direction. </p>

				<p> For the actual trajectories, we can solve for them in the same way as the
					calculations before this example. We can rewrite this system to give a
					differential equation for the trajectories as <me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(2-x)y}{(2y-6)x}
					</me> which can be rearranged as a
					separable equation to <me>
						\left(2 - \frac{6}{y}\right) dy = \left(\frac{2}{x} - 1\right) dx.
					</me>
					Solving this gives <me>
						2y - 6\ln(y) + C = 2\ln(x) - x
					</me> or <me>
						C = 2\ln(x) + 6\ln(y) - x - 2y.
					</me> This will be used to draw the
					trajectories in . </p>

				<p> This can also be seen using a nullcline analysis. The nullclines we need to draw
					are <m>x=0</m>, <m>y=0</m>, <m>x=2</m> and <m>y=3</m>. Our discussion previously
					shows that the arrow in the bottom-right quadrant should point to the lower
					left, and the arrow in the top left should point up and right. We can fill in
					the other two quadrants to see that the solution should move around the circle
					in a clockwise direction. shows the nullcline image and trajectory curves for
					this example. </p>

	<subsection xml:id="competing-species-systems">
		<title>Competing Species systems</title>

		<p> Another application of non-linear systems that also works with population models is a
			competing species interaction. The setup is that there are two species that live in the
			same environment, and need to compete over resources. This means that both species will
			grow on their own, but when the two species interact, it is negative for both species.
			This gives rise to a system of differential equations of the form <me>\begin{split}
			\frac{dx}{dt}&amp;= ax - bxy \\
				\frac{dy}{dt}&amp;= cy - dxy
				\end{split}</me> if both populations grow exponentially, or <me>\begin{split}
			\frac{dx}{dt}&amp;= ax(K-x) - bxy \\
				\frac{dy}{dt}&amp;= cy(M-y) - dxy
				\end{split}</me> if both species grow logistically. The numbers here are all
			positive constants that explain how the different populations affect growth rates. For
			the logistic model, letâ€™s look at the equilibrium solutions. For this, we need <me>x(aK
			- ax - by) = 0 \qquad y(cM - cy - dx) = 0</me> which gives equilibrium solutions at <m>
			(0,0)</m>, <m>(0, M)</m>, and <m>(K, 0)</m>, all of which result in one (or both) of the
			species being extinct. The other equilibrium solution is more interesting, because it
			involves both species coexisting. This happens when <me>by = aK - ax \qquad cy = cM -
			dx.</me> Solving this gives a critical point with <m>x &gt; 0</m> and <m>y&gt;0</m>. </p>

		<p> The Jacobian matrix for this system is <me>J(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix} aK - 2ax - by &amp;
			-bx \\ -dy &amp; cM - 2cy - dx \end{bmatrix} .</me>
		</p>

		<p> Unlike the predator-prey system that always had the same type of equilibriums solution
			every time, there are multiple options for how this system can behave based on the
			values of <m>a,\ b,\ c,\ d,\ K</m>, and <m>M</m>. It is possible that the coexistence
			equilibrium solution will be a nodal sink, so that all nearby solutions will converge to
			it over time, and the species will continue to exist in harmony. However, it is also
			possible that the coexistence solution is a saddle and the solutions at <m>(K,0)</m> and <m>
			(0,M)</m> are sinks. This means that coexistence is unstable, and that over time, the
			populations will converge to one of the other two equilibrium solutions, meaning that
			one of the species will die out as time goes on. Determining which will survive will
			require a numerical model since these equations can not be solved analytically. </p>


		<example>
			<title> </title>
			<statement>
				<p> Analyze the competing species model given by the system of differential
					equations <me>x' = x(4-x-2y) \qquad y' = y(7 - y - 3x).</me> Is the coexistence
					solution stable or unstable? What will happen to the populations over time? </p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p> Solving for the equilibrium solutions gives <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(4, 0)</m>, <m>(0,
					7)</m>, and the coexistence solution where <me>4 - x = 2y \qquad y = 7-3x.</me>
					Simplifying this gives <me>4 - x = 14 - 6x</me> or <m>x=2</m>. The second
					equation then implies that <m>y=1</m>. </p>

				<p> The Jacobian for this system is <me>J(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix} 4 - 2x - 2y &amp;
					-2x \\ -3y &amp; 7 - 2y - 3x \end{bmatrix}.</me>
				</p>

				<p> Evaluating this matrix at the point <m>(2,1)</m> gives <me>\begin{bmatrix} -2
					&amp; -4 \\ -3 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix},</me> which we need to find the
					eigenvalues to classify what type of linearized solution we have here. These are
					determined by <me>(-2-\lambda)(-1-\lambda) - 12 = \lambda^2 + 3\lambda - 9 = 0.</me>
					Thus, the eigenvalues are given by <me>\lambda = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 36}}{2}</me>
					which will be real with opposite signs. Therefore, this equilibrium solution is
					a saddle, and unstable. To confirm this, we can also check the equilibrium
					solutions at <m>(4,0)</m> and <m>(0,7)</m>. For <m>(4,0)</m>, we get the matrix <me>\begin{bmatrix}
					-8 &amp; -8 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}</me> which is a nodal sink. For <m>(0,7)</m>,
					we get <me>\begin{bmatrix} -10 &amp; 0 \\ -21 &amp; -7 \end{bmatrix}</me> which
					is also a nodal sink. Thus, we see that the coexistence equilibrium solution is
					unstable, and both of the equilibrium solutions with one species extinct are
					stable. Therefore, over time, one of the two species will die off depending on
					the initial population. </p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Showing that a system of equations has a stable solution can be a very difficult
			problem. When Isaac Newton put forth his laws of planetary motions, he proved that a
			single planet orbiting a single sun is a stable system. But any solar system with more
			than 1 planet proved very difficult indeed. In fact, such a system behaves chaotically
			(see ), meaning small changes in initial conditions lead to very different long-term
			outcomes. From numerical experimentation and measurements, we know the earth will not
			fly out into the empty space or crash into the sun, for at least some millions of years
			or so. But we do not know what happens beyond that.
