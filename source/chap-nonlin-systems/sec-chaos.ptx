		<p> You have surely heard the idea of the <q>butterfly effect,</q> that the flap of a
			butterfly wing in the Amazon can cause hurricanes in the North Atlantic. In a prior
			section, we mentioned that a small change in initial conditions of the planets can lead
			to very different configuration of the planets in the long term. These are examples of <em></em>.
			Mathematical chaos is not really chaos, there is precise order behind the scenes.
			Everything is still deterministic. However a chaotic system is extremely sensitive to
			initial conditions. This also means even small errors induced via numerical
			approximation create large errors very quickly, so it is almost impossible to
			numerically approximate for long times. This is a large part of the trouble, as chaotic
			systems cannot be in general solved analytically. </p>

		<p>
			Take the weather, the most well-known chaotic system. A small change in the initial
			conditions (the temperature at every point of the atmosphere for example) produces
			drastically different predictions in relatively short time, and so we cannot accurately
			predict weather. And we do not actually know the exact initial conditions. We measure
			temperatures at a few points with some error, and then we somehow estimate what is in
			between. There is no way we can accurately measure the effects of every butterfly wing.
			Then we solve the equations numerically introducing new errors. You should not trust
			weather prediction more than a few days out.
		</p>

		<p> Chaotic behavior was first noticed by Edward Lorenz<fn>
				
					<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Norton
			Lorenz</url> (1917–2008) was an American mathematician and meteorologist. 
			</fn>
			in the 1960s when trying to model thermally induced air convection (movement). Lorentz
			was looking at the relatively simple system: <me>
				x' = -10x +10y, \qquad y' = 28x-y-xz, \qquad z'=-\frac{8}{3}z + xy .
			</me> A small
			change in the initial conditions yields a very different solution after a reasonably
			short time. </p>

			A simple example the reader can experiment with, and which displays chaotic behavior, is
			a double pendulum. The equations for this setup are somewhat complicated, and their
			derivation is quite , so we will not bother to write them down. The idea is to put a
			pendulum on the end of another pendulum. The movement of the bottom mass will appear
			chaotic. This type of chaotic system is a basis for a whole number of office novelty
			desk toys. It is simple to build a version. Take a piece of a string. Tie two heavy nuts
			at different points of the string; one at the end, and one a bit above. Now give the
			bottom nut a little push. As long as the swings are not too big and the string stays
			tight, you have a double pendulum system.

		<title>Duffing equation and strange attractors</title>

		<p> Let us study the so-called <em></em>: <me>
				x'' + a x' + bx + cx^3 = C \cos(\omega t) .
			</me> Here <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, <m>
			C</m>, and <m>\omega</m> are constants. Except for the <m>c x^3</m> term, this equation
			looks like a forced mass-spring system. The <m>c x^3</m> means the spring does not
			exactly obey Hooke’s law (which no real-world spring actually does obey exactly). When <m>
			c</m> is not zero, the equation does not have a closed form solution, so we must resort
			to numerical solutions, as is usual for nonlinear systems. Not all choices of constants
			and initial conditions exhibit chaotic behavior. Let us study <me>
				x''+0.05 x' + x^3 = 8\cos(t) .
			</me>

		</p>

		<p> The equation is not autonomous, so we cannot draw the vector field in the phase plane.
			We can still draw the trajectories. In we plot trajectories for <m>t</m> going from 0 to
			15, for two very close initial conditions <m>(2,3)</m> and <m>(2,2.9)</m>, and also the
			solutions in the <m>(x,t)</m> space. The two trajectories are close at first, but after
			a while diverge significantly. This sensitivity to initial conditions is precisely what
			we mean by the system behaving chaotically. </p>

		<p> Let us see the long term behavior. In , we plot the behavior of the system for initial
			conditions <m>(2,3)</m> for a longer period of time. It is hard to see any particular
			pattern in the shape of the solution except that it seems to oscillate, but each
			oscillation appears quite unique. The oscillation is expected due to the forcing term.
			We mention that to produce the picture accurately, a ridiculously large number of steps<fn>
				
					In fact for reference, 30,000 steps were used with the Runge–Kutta algorithm,
			see exercises in .
				
			</fn>
			had to be used in the numerical algorithm, as even small errors quickly propagate in a
			chaotic system. </p>

		<p>
			It is very difficult to analyze chaotic systems, or to find the order behind the
			madness, but let us try to do something that we did for the standard mass-spring system.
			One way we analyzed the system is that we figured out what was the long term behavior
			(not dependent on initial conditions). From the figure above, it is clear that we will
			not get a nice exact description of the long term behavior for this chaotic system, but
			perhaps we can find some order to what happens on each and what do these oscillations
			have in common.
		</p>

		<p> The concept we explore is that of a <em></em> <fn>
				 Named for the French polymath <url
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Jules Henri
			Poincaré</url> (1854–1912). 
			</fn>. Instead of looking at <m>t</m> in a
			certain interval, we look at where the system is at a certain sequence of points in
			time. Imagine flashing a strobe at a fixed frequency and drawing the points where the
			solution is during the flashes. The right strobing frequency depends on the system in
			question. The correct frequency for the forced Duffing equation (and other similar
			systems) is the frequency of the forcing term. For the Duffing equation above, find a
			solution <m>\bigl(x(t),y(t)\bigr)</m>, and look at the points <me>
				\bigl(x(0),y(0)\bigr), \quad
				\bigl(x(2\pi),y(2\pi)\bigr), \quad
				\bigl(x(4\pi),y(4\pi)\bigr), \quad
				\bigl(x(6\pi),y(6\pi)\bigr), \quad \ldots
			</me>
			As we are really not interested in the transient part of the solution, that is, the part
			of the solution that depends on the initial condition, we skip some number of steps in
			the beginning. For example, we might skip the first 100 such steps and start plotting
			points at <m>t = 100(2\pi)</m>, that is <me>
				\bigl(x(200\pi),y(200\pi)\bigr), \quad
				\bigl(x(202\pi),y(202\pi)\bigr), \quad
				\bigl(x(204\pi),y(204\pi)\bigr), \quad \ldots
			</me>
			The plot of these points is the Poincaré section. After plotting enough points, a
			curious pattern emerges in (the left-hand picture), a so-called <em></em>. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> Given a sequence of points, an <em></em> is a set towards which the points in the
			sequence eventually get closer and closer to, that is, they are attracted. The Poincaré
			section is not really the attractor itself, but as the points are very close to it, we
			see its shape. The strange attractor is a very complicated set. It has fractal
			structure, that is, if you zoom in as far as you want, you keep seeing the same
			complicated structure. </p>

		<p>
			The initial condition makes no difference. If we start with a different initial
			condition, the points eventually gravitate towards the attractor, and so as long as we
			throw away the first few points, we get the same picture. Similarly small errors in the
			numerical approximations do not matter here.
		</p>

		<p>
			An amazing thing is that a chaotic system such as the Duffing equation is not random at
			all. There is a very complicated order to it, and the strange attractor says something
			about this order. We cannot quite say what state the system will be in eventually, but
			given the fixed strobing frequency we narrow it down to the points on the attractor.
		</p>

		<p> If we use a phase shift, for example <m>\nicefrac{\pi}{4}</m>, and look at the times <me>
			\nicefrac{\pi}{4}, \quad
				2\pi+\nicefrac{\pi}{4}, \quad
				4\pi+\nicefrac{\pi}{4}, \quad
				6\pi+\nicefrac{\pi}{4}, \quad
				\ldots
			</me>
			we obtain a slightly different attractor. The picture is the right-hand side of . It is
			as if we had rotated, moved, and slightly distorted the original. For each phase shift
			you can find the set of points towards which the system periodically keeps coming back
			to. </p>

		<p>
			Study the pictures and notice especially the scales—where are these attractors located
			in the phase plane. Notice the regions where the strange attractor lives and compare it
			to the plot of the trajectories in .
		</p>

		<p> Let us compare this section to the discussion in about forced oscillations. Take the
			equation <me>
				x''+2p x' + \omega_0^2 x = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos (\omega t) .
			</me> This is like the
			Duffing equation, but with no <m>x^3</m> term. The steady periodic solution is of the
			form <me>
				x = C \cos (\omega t + \gamma) .
			</me> Strobing using the frequency <m>\omega</m>, we
			obtain a single point in the phase space. The attractor in this setting is a single
			point—an expected result as the system is not chaotic. It was the opposite of chaotic:
			Any difference induced by the initial conditions dies away very quickly, and we settle
			into always the same steady periodic motion. </p>

	<subsection xml:id="the-lorenz-system">
		<title>The Lorenz system</title>

		<p>
			In two dimensions to find chaotic behavior, we must study forced, or non-autonomous,
			systems such as the Duffing equation. The Poincaré–Bendixson Theorem says that a
			solution to an autonomous two-dimensional system that exists for all time in the future
			and does not go towards infinity is periodic or tends towards a periodic solution.
			Hardly the chaotic behavior we are looking for.
		</p>

		<p> In three dimensions even autonomous systems can be chaotic. Let us very briefly return
			to the <me>
				x' = -10x +10y, \qquad y' = 28x-y-xz, \qquad z'=-\frac{8}{3}z + xy .
			</me> The Lorenz
			system is an autonomous system in three dimensions exhibiting chaotic behavior. See the
			for a sample trajectory, which is now a curve in three-dimensional space. </p>

		<!-- div attr= class="myfig"-->
		<!--</div
		attr= class="myfig">-->

		<p> The solutions tend to an <em>attractor</em> in space, the so-called <em></em>. In this
			case no strobing is necessary. Again we cannot quite see the attractor itself, but if we
			try to follow a solution for long enough, as in the figure, we get a pretty good picture
			of what the attractor looks like. The Lorenz attractor is also a strange attractor and
			has a complicated fractal structure. And, just as for the Duffing equation, what we want
			to draw is not the whole trajectory, but start drawing the trajectory after a while,
			once it is close to the attractor. </p>

		<p> The path of the trajectory is not simply a repeating figure-eight. The trajectory spins
			some seemingly random number of times on the left, then spins a number of times on the
			right, and so on. As this system arose in weather prediction, one can perhaps imagine a
			few days of warm weather and then a few days of cold weather, where it is not easy to
			predict when the weather will change, just as it is not really easy to predict far in
			advance when the solution will jump onto the other side. See for a plot of the <m>x</m>
			component of the solution drawn above. A negative <m>x</m> corresponds to the left and a
			positive <m>x</m> corresponds to the right . </p>

		<p>
			Most of the mathematics we studied in this book is quite classical and well understood.
			On the other hand, chaos, including the Lorenz system, continues to be the subject of
			current research. Furthermore, chaos has found applications not just in the sciences,
			but also in art.
