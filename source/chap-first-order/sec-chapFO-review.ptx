				Bernoulli the snail slithers along a tabletop measuring 20 inches across, starting at one edge with a remarkable speed of 4 inches per hour. Bernoulli is afraid of falling off the other edge of the tableâ€”as you would be too if you were a snail. Accordingly, he slows down so that <em>the speed of the snail is proportional to the square of the distance remaining</em>. How long will it take Bernoulli to get halfway across the table?
